Her idea of play is to freely sew to make "fabric" out of small scraps. Her made-fabric used in traditional blocks gives the blocks a modern look.<br><br>If the reader has forgotten how to play, the book includes 11 challenges that are designed to loosen up the creative inner child. (Stevii Graves, Journal of the International Quilt Association, July 2010 <i>International Quilt Association Journal, May 28, 2013</i>)<br><br>More than anything else, this is a book about how to break away from making quilts by copying what others have done and following step-by-step instructions to systematically create a finished piece. Victoria's emphasis is on process, not product. While she does provide a fairly detailed guide to four different ways of sewing scraps of fabric together to make blocks that you can then cut up and use in your patchwork blocks&#x2014;'crumb piecing', as it is commonly known&#x2014;her focus in on developing your creative spirit and giving yourself permission to have fun and go with the flow. She sets 11 creative challenges, such as "Use fabric you don't think you can use" and "Make a medallion quilt from a set of previously-made blocks that never grew into a quilt". A lot of readers will feel uncomfortable with Victoria's approach, but you'll be using loads of tiny scraps of fabric you possibly don't value all that much&#x2014;that is, you don't need to buy or cup up gorgeous yardage. And this approach might be a revelation that opens doors to all kinds of new opportunities. The book includes photographs of lots of quilts made by a cross-section of creative minds.

Her famous (and now very rich) father, is a &#x2018;celebrity&#x2019; cook, divorced from Jenny&#x2019;s mother. Jenny drives a disreputable cherry-red van, and is happy travelling the country catering events and cooking great food. She is on a one-woman crusade to bring back &#x2018;real&#x2019; food.

She finds crime very distracting, especially when there is chocolate to temper or pike to poach. Nevertheless, she is very good at reading people, and with a quick and agile brain, becomes very good at unmasking killers. And her always-undaunted sense of humour goes a long way in keeping her sane when all around her people are dropping like flies.<br><br>FAITH MARTIN is the best-selling author of the <b>DETECTIVE HILLARY GREENE mysteries</b>, which have sold over 1 million copies globally in just over a year.<br><br><b>More JENNY STARLING mysteries coming soon.</b> Join the Joffe Books mailing list to be the first to hear about the next in the series.</p><p></p><h2>Linnets and Valerians</h2><p>When Nan, Robert, Timothy, and Betsy s father went off to explore in Egypt, he left the children with their grandmother who lived in the English countryside. Unfortunately she did not much like children, much less their dog, Absalom. So the children ran away to stay with their Uncle Ambrose, an eccentric, strict, and loveable retired school teacher who was determined to give them an Education, but in addition to Greek, Latin, and Literature, the Linnet children learned much more about nature and magic, the power of the past and Pan, and, of course, the importance of the bees. They used their knowledge to find the lost Valerians, undo some very wicked, ancient spells, and reunite a divided family. The word enchanting is overused, but in this case it applies. <p>As this world becomes increasingly ugly, callous and materialistic it needs to be reminded that the old fairy stories are rooted in truth, that imagination is of value, that happy endings do, in fact, occur, and that the blue spring mist that make an ugly street look beautiful is just as real a thing as the street itself. </p><p></p><p>Elizabeth Goudge writes with the gentleness and good humor that have long endeared her to adult readers . . . blending fantasy and fact with the sure touch of the born storyteller.

The charismatic and hard-bitten director and actor John Huston is at the center of the book, determined to make Stephen Crane&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Red Badge of Courage</i>&#x2014;one of the great and defining works of American literature, the first modern war novel, a book whose vivid imagistic style invites the description of cinematic&#x2014;into a movie that is worthy of it. At first all goes well, as Huston shoots and puts together a two-hour film that is, he feels, the best he&#x2019;s ever made. Then the studio bosses step in and the audience previews begin, conferences are held, and the movie is taken out of Huston&#x2019;s hands, cut down by a third, and finally released&#x2014;with results that please no one and certainly not the public: It was an expensive flop. In&nbsp;<i>Picture</i>, which Charlie Chaplin aptly described as &#x201c;brilliant and sagacious,&#x201d; Ross is a gadfly on the wall taking note of the operations of a system designed to crank out mediocrity.</p><p><b>Lillian Ross&nbsp;</b>(1918&#x2013;2017), born Lillian Rosovsky, grew up in Syracuse and Brooklyn, New York. In 1945,&nbsp;she&nbsp;joined&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker&nbsp;</i>and was a staff writer there for seven decades. She was the author of eleven books, including&nbsp;<i>Portrait of Hemingway</i>,&nbsp;<i>Vertical and Horizontal</i>,&nbsp;<i>Reporting</i>,<i>The Player</i>,&nbsp;<i>Here But Not Here</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Reporting Back: Notes on Journalism</i>. She spent much of her life with the journalist and editor William Shawn. Her work is considered to be a major influence in the field of literary journalism.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Angelica Huston</b>is an actress and director. Born in Santa Monica, California, she is the daughter of John Huston and&nbsp;the&nbsp;ballerina Enrica Soma. Huston began acting in the late 1960s, taking small roles in her father&#x2019;s films, and in 1985 won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance in&nbsp;<i>Prizzi&#x2019;s Honor</i>. She went on to have roles in numerous films, including&nbsp;<i>The Addams Family</i>,&nbsp;<i>Ever After: A Cinderella Story</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Royal Tenenbaums</i>. Huston&#x2019;s directorial debut was&nbsp;<i>Bastard Out of Carolina&nbsp;</i>in 1996, followed by&nbsp;<i>Agnes Browne&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Riding the Bus with My Sister</i>.&#x201c;<i>Picture</i>&nbsp;is a dazzling realist confection ... [T]he dialogue is perfect, with pace and tension steady ...&nbsp;<i>Picture</i>&nbsp;tells the truth as the writer found it to be, and, by steady accumulation and good writing, we see all the things about the movie business that lie beyond publicity.&#x201d; &#x2014;Andrew O&#x2019;Hagan,&nbsp;<i>London Review of Books</i><br><br>"Ross, in her reporting, does what novelists of the first order do in their fiction: she brings abstractions to life, she catches and depicts the passions that motivate people to reach high, to plot deftly, to compromise, to take foolish risks or hedge their bets. Yet, no less than in her exemplary Profile of Hemingway, Ross also explores the inner life of an artist, in an attempt to illuminate the mysteries of the art itself.&#x201d; &#x2014;Richard Brody, <i>The New Yorker</i><br><br>&#x201c;Here is probably the most authentic documentation ever done on the making of a Hollywood motion picture and it is presented with such brilliance, fidelity to detail, and characterization that it reads like an exciting novel.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune<br><br></i>&#x201c;<i>Picture</i>&nbsp;presents Hollywood&#x2019;s more heroic attitudes as well as its more foolish and familiar ones. Never blind to Hollywood&#x2019;s persistent creative effort, it is sharply observant of the business mechanism that blunts the points of some of the industry&#x2019;s sharper talents. It plays back with an unfailing ear some of the wise things that are said in that keyed-up, pent-up industrial town, as well as the wise-cracking, the bathetic and banal.&#x201d; &#x2014;Budd Schulberg,&nbsp;<i>The New York Times&nbsp;</i></p><h2>Made by Hand: Furniture Projects from the Unplugged Woodshop</h2><p><p><b>Learn the simplicity of using hand tools, while you build!</b></p><p>Traditional woodworking using hand tools can offer a more satisfying relationship with the wood and the creative woodworking process. It's quieter, cleaner and maybe even a little spiritual. It's no surprise that many "plugged-in" woodworkers are returning to the roots of this treasured skill. Where some hand-tool books focus solely on the use of hand tools, <i>Made By Hand</i> takes you right to the bench and shows you how to start building furniture using these tools.</p><p>By working through the six projects in this book, you'll learn the basics of hand-tool woodworking and how to use the tools effectively and efficiently, then add joinery skills and design complexity. The accompanying DVD includes valuable insight into the tools themselves and a look at the techniques that make these tools work so well.</p><p>If you're interested in hand tools, start here!</p></p><p>Tom Fidgen builds custom furniture using hand tools and fine, hand-selected hardwoods.

And he&#x2019;s not even a year old yet.&#x201d; She gave Peanut the Labradoodle a fond pat on his head. Peanut responded with a happy bark. His tail thumped against the plush carpet by An&#x2019;gel&#x2019;s chair.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, he sees you do something one time, and he doesn&#x2019;t forget it.&#x201d; Miss Dickce Ducote, at eighty the younger sister by four years, beamed at the wriggling dog. &#x201c;Benjy, you&#x2019;ve done wonders with this dog&#x2019;s training the past two months.&#x201d;</p><p>Benjy Stephens smiled. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not hard to train. Like Miss An&#x2019;gel says, he&#x2019;s really smart.&#x201d;</p><p>Endora, an Abyssinian cat with a ruddy coat, surveyed the dog&#x2019;s antics from her vantage point atop the back of Dickce&#x2019;s chair. Her tail flicked in a languorous motion every few seconds close to Dickce&#x2019;s right ear.</p><p>Benjy laughed and pointed at the cat. &#x201c;Endora doesn&#x2019;t look all that impressed.&#x201d;</p><p>Peanut barked and picked up An&#x2019;gel&#x2019;s empty suitcase by its handle with his teeth and carried it to the closet. He placed it inside, then with his right front paw swung shut the closet door. He turned to face his audience, and An&#x2019;gel told him what a clever boy he was.</p><p>&#x201c;Come sit, Peanut.&#x201d; An&#x2019;gel motioned for the Labradoodle to approach her chair, and the dog obeyed instantly. An&#x2019;gel turned to Benjy. &#x201c;How is your room? Is it comfortable?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; Benjy nodded. &#x201c;These guest cottages are pretty awesome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cousin Mireille had them redone a couple of years ago, she said.&#x201d; Dickce glanced around the living room of the two-bedroom cottage she was sharing with An&#x2019;gel. While the furniture here was reproduction, it was in the style of the antiques in the main house. &#x201c;I gather her bed-and-breakfast business does well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;St. Ignatiusville is a pretty town, I grant you.&#x201d; An&#x2019;gel shook her head. &#x201c;But I fail to understand why it&#x2019;s such a popular tourist destination.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lot of history here in Louisiana,&#x201d; Benjy said. &#x201c;I was reading the brochure in my room. Just like with Riverhill, I guess.&#x201d;</p><p>Riverhill, the Ducote family home, was built in the early 1830s in Athena, Mississippi. Willowbank, ancestral home to the sisters&#x2019; cousin Mireille Champlain, dated to the late eighteenth century.</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose so,&#x201d; Dickce said. &#x201c;Willowbank is larger, of course, with its third story and the galleries around the upper floors. There&#x2019;s a smaller version in the Vieux Carr� in New Orleans, but Mireille sold it years ago.&#x201d;</p><p>An&#x2019;gel checked her watch. &#x201c;Now that we&#x2019;ve unpacked, I suppose we should go over to the main house and check in with Mireille. No doubt there are things we can help her with.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Three days before her granddaughter&#x2019;s wedding?&#x201d; Dickce laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure she can find something for us to do.&#x201d; She cut a sideways glance at Benjy. &#x201c;Sure you won&#x2019;t change your mind and come with us? I bet Sondra will put on a show.&#x201d;</p><p>Benjy grinned. &#x201c;If she&#x2019;s as spoiled as you say, I bet she will. Right now, though, I think it would be better if I stayed here with Peanut and Endora. There&#x2019;s no telling what they might get up to. Peanut gets so excited when there&#x2019;s new people to meet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; An&#x2019;gel said, &#x201c;and Mireille&#x2019;s front parlor is full of Meissen and Limoges&#x2014;or at least it used to be.&#x201d; She rose. &#x201c;Good plan, Benjy. Come along, Sister.&#x201d;</p><p>Peanut whined when the door opened, but at a command from Benjy, he quieted and stayed where he was. Endora examined her front right paw and yawned.</p><p>The door closed behind them, An&#x2019;gel and Dickce followed the path around an ornamental pond that separated the bed-and-breakfast cottages from Willowbank itself, about two hundred yards away. A mix of willows and live oaks bordered half the pond to the east, and over to the south, a grand procession of live oaks marked the circular drive that led up to the front door of the plantation house.</p><p>The sisters trod carefully around the pond, not eager to encounter anything reptilian, particularly snakes. The October afternoon was warm, but pleasant breezes kept the atmosphere temperate. The many trees cast a lot of shade, and An&#x2019;gel paused in front of one bordering the drive for a moment and gazed at the house.</p><p>Willowbank was a magnificent structure in the Greek Revival style, larger than most of its period. Generations of the Champlain clan had lavished considerable money on its upkeep, and it survived as a reminder of the graciousness of certain aspects of the Southern planter class&#x2019;s lifestyle. Mireille, a Champlain by birth, had married a third cousin who was also a Champlain. She was the last of the name to own the house.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s spectacular,&#x201d; An&#x2019;gel murmured, &#x201c;but I still prefer Riverhill.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course you do,&#x201d; Dickce answered tartly. &#x201c;So do I, because Riverhill is in our DNA. Just the way Willowbank and all it stands for is in Mireille&#x2019;s. Lordy, you do get maudlin sometimes.&#x201d;</p><p>An&#x2019;gel graced her sister with a withering glance.</p><p>Unwithered, Dickce marched forward. &#x201c;Come on, Mireille&#x2019;s expecting us.&#x201d; She stepped from the grass onto the gravel that formed the surface of the drive and headed toward the steps up to the veranda.</p><p>An&#x2019;gel followed her, eager to see Mireille and find out about the wedding. She also looked forward to seeing Jacqueline, her goddaughter and mother of the bride. They kept in touch somewhat infrequently through e-mail, but they hadn&#x2019;t seen each other face-to-face in over five years.</p><p>A thin black man, wizened by age, opened the door to An&#x2019;gel&#x2019;s knock. &#x201c;Good afternoon, Jackson. It&#x2019;s wonderful to see you again.&#x201d; She held out her hand.</p><p>Jackson, dressed in black tie and tails, smiled broadly as he clasped the proffered hand in both of his own. &#x201c;Miss An&#x2019;gel, it sure has been way too long. And Miss Dickce, too. Y&#x2019;all are a happy sight for these old eyes. Welcome back to Willowbank.&#x201d; He waved them inside.</p><p>An&#x2019;gel knew Jackson was well over eighty, but he seemed fit enough despite his age. She also knew he was devoted to Mireille, and Mireille relied heavily on him. They had grown up together at Willowbank, where Jackson started as a stable boy when he was only seven. An&#x2019;gel figured the house would have to fall in before Jackson would even think about retiring.</p><p>&#x201c;Miss Mireille sure has been looking forward to seeing you,&#x201d; the butler said over his shoulder as he ambled toward the front parlor. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s near run ragged with all these wedding goings-on, and you know how Miss Sondra does like to fuss.&#x201d;</p><p>An&#x2019;gel and Dickce exchanged glances. They were not surprised the bride-to-be was up to her usual antics.</p><p>Jackson paused about three feet from the parlor door, and An&#x2019;gel could hear a raised voice coming from inside the room. The butler cocked his head to one side. He shook it and frowned. &#x201c;Miss Sondra cuts up something terrible, and Miss Mireille, well, she don&#x2019;t have the heart to say nothing. Nor Miss Jacqueline either.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know how to handle Miss Sondra,&#x201d; An&#x2019;gel said.</p><p>Jackson&#x2019;s lips split in a grin. &#x201c;I reckon you do, Miss An&#x2019;gel.&#x201d; He stepped forward and opened the double parlor doors.</p><p>An&#x2019;gel and Dickce followed him inside, and both winced immediately as the bride-to-be&#x2019;s voice assaulted their ears.</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t, I won&#x2019;t, I won&#x2019;t, <i>Grand-m�re</i>, no matter what you say. I&#x2019;m not wearing that hideous old-fashioned dress down the aisle. Lance would take one look at me and run away screaming. I won&#x2019;t, no matter what, I won&#x2019;t, I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>The young woman&#x2019;s voice seemed to rise on almost every syllable, until the final words came out at such a high pitch An&#x2019;gel had to wonder how long it would take all the dogs in the vicinity to come running.</p><p>Sondra Delevan, in calmer circumstances, made men stop in their tracks and women want to push her off the nearest tall building. An&#x2019;gel had rarely seen such perfect blond beauty. Sondra&#x2019;s lustrous hair, thick and almost to the waist, was the color of spun golden silk. Her lips were full and red, and her eyes a deep blue. Her face appeared perfectly sculpted.</p><p>At the moment, however, she resembled a middle-aged harpy in full flight instead of a young woman who would soon turn twenty-one. Her face was a blotchy red, and her eyes were wild. Her chest heaved from the force of her tantrum.</p><p>Her grandmother Mireille sat quietly on a sofa near the fireplace. &#x201c;My grandmother and my mother wore that dress on their wedding days. I wore it, and so did your mother. I simply thought tradition might mean something to you.&#x201d; She sighed heavily. &#x201c;You might have mentioned this earlier since we&#x2019;ve had the dress altered to fit you. Three days before your wedding is hardly the time to go looking for a suitable dress. Surely you understand how difficult that&#x2019;s going to be.&#x201d;</p><p>An&#x2019;gel needed only one swift glance at her cousin to detect the strained expression, the weary set of her shoulders, and a general air of exhaustion. Though Mireille was eight years younger than An&#x2019;gel, at the moment she appeared a decade older.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to wear dead women&#x2019;s clothes on my wedding day, no matter what you say. I don&#x2019;t care what I said before. I&#x2019;ve changed my mind.&#x201d; Sondra stamped her foot hard on the ancient Aubusson carpet. &#x201c;Makes my skin crawl just to think about it. I won&#x2019;t, I won&#x2019;t, I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; She kept repeating those two words over and over.</p><p>An&#x2019;gel had had enough. Mireille might put up with this ridiculous behavior, but she wasn&#x2019;t going to.</p><p>She spotted a vase filled with cut flowers on a table near her. She moved over, pulled out the flowers, and placed them on the table. A check inside the vase assured her there was enough water for her purpose. She took a couple of steps closer to the still-ranting Sondra and dumped the water over the girl&#x2019;s head.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even open your mouth.&#x201d; An&#x2019;gel stood in front of Sondra and stared hard into her eyes. &#x201c;You march right upstairs and clean yourself up, and you come back downstairs with a good attitude. Your grandmother has had enough of this, and I&#x2019;m not going to let you treat her this way.&#x201d;</p><p>Sondra glared right back at her. She opened her mouth, but An&#x2019;gel didn&#x2019;t give her a chance to speak.</p><p>&#x201c;What did I tell you? Get yourself upstairs <i>this minute</i>, Sondra, or I might turn you over my knee and wallop your behind.&#x201d; An&#x2019;gel held up her right hand in a menacing gesture.</p><p>Sondra darted an outraged glance at her grandmother, but Mireille looked away. Evidently deciding that discretion was the better part of valor, Sondra ducked around An&#x2019;gel and ran out of the room. Moments later An&#x2019;gel heard footsteps pounding up the wooden stairs.</p><p>&#x201c;Surely that was a bit excessive, An&#x2019;gel.&#x201d; Mireille&#x2019;s tone was mild, but An&#x2019;gel could tell her cousin was not pleased.</p><p>&#x201c;Your granddaughter&#x2019;s behavior wasn&#x2019;t, I suppose?&#x201d; An&#x2019;gel tried to keep the edge of sarcasm from her tone but didn&#x2019;t completely succeed. She walked over to the sofa and sat by Mireille. She picked up her cousin&#x2019;s left hand and patted it. &#x201c;Even a stranger could see that you&#x2019;re exhausted, and there&#x2019;s no excuse for putting up with that kind of behavior.&#x201d;</p><p>Mireille leaned back and closed her eyes. Her voice came out barely above a whisper. &#x201c;I know, and you&#x2019;re right, my nerves are at the breaking point. We&#x2019;ve indulged that child all her life, and you see what she&#x2019;s become.&#x201d; She rubbed her forehead with her free hand. &#x201c;And now we have to find her another dress.&#x201d;</p><p>Dickce made herself comfortable in a chair across from the other women. &#x201c;Mireille, honey, An&#x2019;gel and I are here to help, and we&#x2019;ll take as much of the strain off you as we can. We&#x2019;ll even take Sondra shopping for another dress, though it will probably be a complete waste of time.&#x201d;</p><p>Mireille&#x2019;s eyelids fluttered open, and a dab of color reappeared in her cheeks. She pulled her hand from An&#x2019;gel&#x2019;s grasp and sat up. &#x201c;Bless you both for that.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;Perhaps Sondra will behave better, now that she&#x2019;s found someone who will stand up to her. Jacqueline and I can&#x2019;t. Never could.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jacqueline couldn&#x2019;t what?&#x201d; A new voice entered the conversation.</p><p>An&#x2019;gel glanced toward the doorway to see her goddaughter approaching. Jacqueline Mims was a blurred, shopworn copy of her only child. An&#x2019;gel winced inwardly at the change in the woman since they had last met. Jacqueline had let her hair go gray, though there were still a few streaks of faded blond. She looked a couple of decades older than her forty-five years. An&#x2019;gel wondered if Sondra was the reason for her mother&#x2019;s haggard appearance, or was there trouble in her second marriage? Jacqueline had not confided any problems in their most recent exchange of e-mails.</p><p>An&#x2019;gel rose as Jacqueline stopped in front of her, and clasped her goddaughter&#x2019;s outstretched hands. &#x201c;Hello, my dear, I&#x2019;m so happy to see you.&#x201d; An&#x2019;gel saw no point in ducking the issue. &#x201c;I was saying you could never stand up to your daughter.&#x201d;</p><p>Jacqueline gave a faint smile. &#x201c;<i>Tante</i> An&#x2019;gel, diplomatic as ever.&#x201d; She kissed the older woman&#x2019;s cheek, then released her hands.</p><p>Dickce smothered a laugh as Jacqueline turned to her. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a reason no president ever asked An&#x2019;gel to serve as ambassador.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Tante</i> Dickce, I&#x2019;m so glad you could come.&#x201d; She gave Dickce a kiss on the cheek as well, then took the chair next to her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re both here. <i>Maman</i> and I have our hands full with Sondra.&#x201d; She sighed and closed her eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;You just tell us what needs doing, and we&#x2019;ll pitch right in,&#x201d; An&#x2019;gel said.</p><p>&#x201c;For one thing, you can promise not to dump any more vases of water on Sondra&#x2019;s head.&#x201d; Mireille frowned. &#x201c;I know you meant well, An&#x2019;gel, but that was going too far.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you really?&#x201d; Jacqueline gazed at An&#x2019;gel. At the older woman&#x2019;s nod, she burst into laughter. An&#x2019;gel thought it had a slightly hysterical tinge to it.</p><p>&#x201c;Jacqueline, <i>tais-toi</i>,&#x201d; Mireille said crossly. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t funny. Sondra will be even more difficult now.&#x201d;</p><p>Jacqueline quieted at her mother&#x2019;s command. &#x201c;Sorry, <i>Maman</i>, but it <i>is</i> funny. I wish I had the nerve to do that the next time the little wench has a tantrum.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I regret that you were offended by what I did,&#x201d; An&#x2019;gel told her cousin, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;d do it again. You&#x2019;ve let that child run your lives for far too long. It&#x2019;s time someone got the upper hand with her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly what I&#x2019;ve been saying for years, but of course no one pays attention to the hired help.&#x201d; A short, stocky woman with improbably red hair pushed a tea cart into the room and wheeled it in front of Mireille. &#x201c;That girl needed her behind paddled at least once a day, but no one would make the effort. She&#x2019;d&#x2019;ve turned out a lot nicer if someone had had the backbone to do it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Estelle,&#x201d; An&#x2019;gel said into the uneasy silence that followed the woman&#x2019;s pronouncements. She had often thought Mireille&#x2019;s housekeeper was more than a little rude, but Mireille had done nothing to curb the woman&#x2019;s tongue.</p><p>&#x201c;Miss An&#x2019;gel, Miss Dickce, nice to see you. Maybe the two of you can stiffen up a few spines while you&#x2019;re here. The good Lord knows we need it, but of course the hired help gets ignored when they suggest anything.&#x201d; The housekeeper acknowledged them with curt nods. She pointed to the tea tray. &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be my fault i...</p></p><h2>School Law: What Every Educator Should Know, A User-Friendly Guide</h2><p><b>&nbsp;</b> <p> <b>&nbsp;</b></p><b> <p>Do teachers have a right to dress as they wish?</p> <p>Can Social Studies Teachers be prohibited from discussing controversial issues?</p> <p>When can copyrighted works be copied without permission?</p> </b> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>If you&#x2019;ve ever pondered these or other questions of law, you need to know the right answers!

Sherryl is best known for her ability to creating endearing small town communities and families. She is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 75 romances for Silhouette Desire and Special Edition.<br><br>Unemployed and pregnant! Those were two words Gabriella Castle had never envisioned applying to her, at least not in combination. Now, in a twist of fate she couldn't possibly have anticipated, she was out of work and, just as shocking, expecting a baby. So much for years of fast-track career dedication and workaholic tendencies!<br><br>Sitting in the middle of her comfortably furnished living room in Raleigh, North Carolina, Gabi stared at a painting that had cost more than some people made in a year. Her sister Emily had talked her into it when she'd stayed overnight a few weeks ago. She'd seen it in some fancy auction catalog&#x2014;Sotheby's or someplace like it&#x2014;and insisted it would be just the thing to pull all the colors in Gabi's haphazardly decorated living room together.<br><br>"Besides that, it's a great investment," Emily had said enthusiastically. "In a few years, it will probably triple in value."<br><br>Gabi wondered if she could simply get her money back now. She was probably going to need it.<br><br>In the meantime, she couldn't help wondering if her sister could come up with a painting&#x2014;or a magical formula&#x2014;that would pull her life together.<br><br>Even though it had been three days since she'd walked into her boss's office expecting to be commended on her latest public-relations campaign for their biomedical company, only to leave the room with a severance package, she still couldn't quite believe what had happened. She'd been working since she was eighteen, climbing the corporate ladder since she'd turned twenty-one.<br><br>Driven by ambition and the determination to prove something to her father, she'd worked out a career plan even as she'd scheduled her college classes, taking a succession of internships and summer jobs to gain the experience that would land her a top-notch job after graduation. She'd hoped that job would be with her dad, but Sam Castle had turned her down flat.<br><br>Once hired by a competing company and more driven than ever, she'd made a meteoric rise to become the company's top public-relations executive by the time she was twenty-eight. Everyone had assumed there would be a vice presidency in her future. She'd certainly earned it.<br><br>Unfortunately, it seemed that particular career path didn't blend with being an unmarried mother, not in certain circles, anyway.<br><br>Not that her boss had dared to fire her. No, Amanda Warren had just made it impossible for her to stay. She'd outlined a plan that would keep Gabi well hidden from the judgmental world for the duration of the pregnancy. Beyond that, well, the handwriting had been on the wall. Her days of being a high-profile spokeswoman for the company were over.<br><br>She could have stayed and fought, but still reeling from the news that she was pregnant, she hadn't had the energy for a legal battle. She'd opted instead to negotiate a buyout that would give her a smidgen of dignity, a decent severance package and time to consider her options for the future.<br><br>A future that included a baby! That was, of course, the real kicker&#x2014;the unexpected news that had first left her stunned and shaken and launched this downward spiral.<br><br>It wasn't that she hadn't understood that no method of protection was a hundred percent foolproof, but she'd thought birth control pills and condoms together were reasonably effective. Her boyfriend of five years, Paul Langley, had thought so, too. In fact, he'd been so certain of it, his first reaction had been to suggest that the baby couldn't possibly be his.<br><br>Then, once convinced of the truth, he'd said she was on her own, that a baby wasn't part of their deal. She hadn't even been aware that their relationship was a "deal" only as long as it was convenient for him.<br><br>As she was pondering just how wildly out of control her life suddenly was, her phone rang. According to the caller ID, it was her older sister, Samantha. Knowing Sam would just keep calling until Gabi picked up, she answered, trying to inject an upbeat note into her voice.<br><br>"When you didn't answer your cell phone, I called your office and was told you no longer work there," Samantha said, sounding suitably stunned. "What's going on?"<br><br>Gabi sighed. So much for any chance of keeping her professional catastrophe a secret from her family, at least for a while longer. "I quit," she explained to her sister. "Or was forced out, depending on your point of view."<br><br>"But why?" Samantha inquired, her tone indignant. "Not because you took some time off to go help Grandmother after the hurricane, I hope."<br><br>"No, of course not. They understood about that, and I had a ton of vacation time coming to me. They owed me that time off. If that had been an issue, they'd have let me go months ago."<br><br>"Then why?" Sam asked, sounding gratifyingly bewildered. "You gave that company a national presence. What's wrong with those ungrateful wretches?"<br><br>Gabi smiled at the fierce defense. "Actually, it was the work that gave them a national reputation. I just spread the word."<br><br>"There you go, being all humble, but we both know the truth." Samantha hesitated, then asked, "What are you going to do now, Gabi? Have you decided? I know how important that job was to you. It was your life."<br><br>"And how pitiful is that?" Gabi said, seeing clearly for the first time what a mistake it had been to focus almost exclusively on work. Her relationship with Paul had definitely taken a backseat, something that had suited them both. Unfortunately, given his attitude over recent developments, she doubted that even fulltime devotion would have changed anything.<br><br>"You'll do things differently next time," Samantha soothed. "Now you know that no corporation is worth expending all that time and energy on, not when they can treat you like this. Have you started looking yet?"<br><br>"I'm still trying to wrap my mind around what's happened," Gabi admitted, which was putting it mildly. "With the severance package they gave me, I have some time."<br><br>"Well, you know some other company will scoop you right up. Call Dad. He has a million contacts in that whole biomedical research world down there. Maybe he'll even rethink his previous stance about not hiring family and hire you himself."<br><br>"Not now," Gabi said. Not only did she not want her father to know about the pregnancy just yet, she had a hunch it would pose a problem with other old-fashioned employers, as well. As for her dad, well, his reaction wasn't something she was ready to contemplate.<br><br>"Why not now?" Samantha pressed. "This is one of those rare instances when Dad really could help. He'd even want to."<br><br>"I'm not so sure," Gabi said. Her father was as conservative as anyone. He was very conscious of the need in their field to make the right impression, to demonstrate a seriousness of purpose, no mistakes allowed, personal or professional. He'd been equally rigid with his family. She had a feeling he'd side with her boss and, if that was the case, she didn't want to know it until she had her feet back under her and a plan in place.<br><br>"Is there something you're not telling me?" Samantha asked suspiciously. "I know you. It's not like you to let any grass grow under your feet. I'm surprised you didn't have another job lined up by the end of the day."<br><br>"Haven't you heard? These are tough times."<br><br>"And you're very good at what you do and have the perfect mentor in Dad. Of all of us, you're the closest to him. Why don't you want to ask for his help?"<br><br>Since it was clear Samantha wasn't going to let this go, Gabi sucked in a deep breath, then blurted, "Because I'm going to have a baby, that's why." She nearly choked on the sob that came with the words.<br><br>Dead silence greeted the announcement, before Samantha finally said softly, "Holy saints in heaven! A baby, Gabi? Are you sure?"<br><br>"Do you think I'd have mentioned it to my boss if I hadn't been sure?" Gabi said dryly.<br><br>"And that's why they let you go?" Samantha asked, clearly shocked. "Isn't that illegal?"<br><br>"Technically they didn't let me go. They demoted me, so I negotiated a buyout. A win-win for everyone, according to Amanda. Who knew she was a better spin master than I ever dreamed of being?" Gabi said, unable to keep a bitter note out of her voice.<br><br>"Okay, let's forget the job for the moment. It doesn't matter," Samantha said. "The baby's Paul's."<br><br>Gabi was grateful that there'd been no question mark at the end of her sister's statement. "Of course."<br><br>"How'd he take it?"<br><br>"As if I'd committed a felony. Needless to say, he's no longer in the picture."<br><br>"The rat," Samantha said with feeling. "I never did like him."<br><br>Despite the tense atmosphere, Gabi smiled. "You never even met him."<br><br>"And that's precisely why I didn't like him. What kind of man doesn't want to meet his girlfriend's family? He never even showed his face when we were helping Grandmother after the hurricane."<br><br>"And what a blessing that probably was. Give him a hammer and he'd probably do more harm than good."<br><br>"Not what you need in a man," Samantha declared. "Now Wade Johnson? He's the kind of man to have around in a crisis."<br><br>Gabi stiffened at the out-of-the-blue mention of the man who'd been underfoot nonstop while they were making repairs to the family restaurant, Castle's by the Sea, after the hurricane. "Why would you bring him up?"<br><br>"Because he <em>was</em> around after the storm, just like Boone. And I saw the way Wade looked at you, as if he'd never seen anyone so perfect in his entire life."<br><br>"You're crazy."<br><br>"Let me remind you that I said the same thing to our sister about Boone, and look at the two of them now. In a few months Emily and Boone will be married, assuming he can convince her to finally set a date. I'm good at this stuff, Gabi. I recognize heat between men and women, even when they're both in denial."<br><br>"Well, you're wrong this time. Besides, don't you think the timing is just a little off for me to be thinking about a relationship? I'm going to be having another man's baby in a few months."<br><br>Samantha sucked in a deep breath at the reminder.<br><br>"Are you at least happy about that?" she asked hesitantly. "A baby, Gabi! That is so incredible."<br><br>Gabi rested a hand on her belly, felt the faint stirring there. The first time she'd felt that tiny life inside her, she'd fallen in love. Being pregnant might be inconvenient. It might not have been the result of a love match. It might have cost her a job, but she already loved this baby more than anything. She'd do whatever it took to protect it and make sure it had everything it deserved...including two parents who would treasure this priceless gift when the time came.<br><br>"I'm thinking about adoption," she admitted to Samantha, deciding to test the idea she'd mentioned to no one else.<br><br>Her words were greeted by stunned silence.<br><br>"Samantha? You still there?"<br><br>"You'd give up the baby?"<br><br>Gabi closed her eyes. "I think it's the only way to make sure it has a good life. And, to be honest, I don't want to be tied to Paul through this child. I don't want to take a cent of support money from him. I don't want anyone so selfish in this child's life."<br><br>"Oh, sweetie, forget Paul for the moment," Samantha protested. <em>"You</em> can give this baby a good life. You can surround him or her with a whole family who'll fall in love the instant he or she is born."<br><br>"Babies shouldn't start life with an out-of-work single mother," Gabi said wearily.<br><br>"It's not as if you're going to be destitute. And you'll find another job when the time comes," Samantha insisted. "Plus, we'll all help. Me, Emily, Grandmother, even Dad will be on board. His first grandchild? You know he's going to be thrilled about this."<br><br>"Is he really?" Gabi asked skeptically, sounding more like Emily than herself. Emily was the one who never gave their father credit for having deep feelings for any of them. Besides, Sam Castle had hardly noticed his own children unless they were in trouble. It seemed unlikely he'd be over the moon about a grandchild. The image of him sitting in a rocker cuddling a baby was so incongruous, it was laughable.<br><br>"Well, you don't have to decide right this second," Samantha said, backing off to give her breathing room. "We'll talk about it when I see you."<br><br>"When you see me?" Gabi asked suspiciously. "Since when are you planning a trip back down here?"<br><br>"I'm driving home tomorrow," Samantha said, as if the trip had been scheduled for days, rather than minutes. "Meet me in Sand Castle Bay. You don't have anything to keep you in Raleigh right now, so no arguments. You've already said you're not looking for work just yet, so you might as well enjoy this unexpected time off. You need sunshine and sea breezes to put this in perspective. You know you do. You'll see things much more clearly then."<br><br>"I'm not sure I'm ready to lay this on Grandmother just yet."<br><br>"Be there or Emily and I will come and drag you over there bodily, if we have to," Samantha insisted, refusing to cut her any slack.<br><br>"Emily's there now?" Gabi asked, surprised. "I thought she was working night and day at this new job in Los Angeles."<br><br>"She also has a wedding to plan. And she's still after Grandmother to do a little modernizing of the decor at Castle's. She and Boone flew in a couple of days ago. She claims she wants our opinion on the wedding plans. That's why I called in the first place, to let you know we've been called into action."<br><br>Gabi laughed. "Since when does Emily listen to anything you or I have to say when it comes to her life?"<br><br>"She says there are incredible weddings on those soaps I've been on, and I should know a thing or two. And we're both her sisters, and we're to be in the wedding party. I'd suggest if you don't want to wind up wearing a very unflattering shade of whatever color's in fashion in Hollywood these days, you need to be there to speak up. Listen to me. I'm the oldest. I know best."<br><br>Gabi laughed. "Since when? I've always been the sensible one. Everyone knows that."<br><br>"If that were true, how'd you land in this mess?" Samantha taunted. "See you tomorrow, sweetie. And don't worry. This is going to work out. I promise."<br><br>Gabi hung up and sighed. Sand Castle Bay was the very last place she wanted to go right now, but Samantha was right about one thing. It was exactly where she belonged.<br><br></p><h2>Pocket Dictionary for the Study of New Testament Greek (The IVP Pocket Reference Series)</h2><p>If you are beginning your study of New Testament Greek or Greek exegesis, this book is for you!

In post-World War II Los Angeles, as power was concentrating and fortunes were being made, a do-it-yourself culture of cool cats, outsiders, and oddballs populated the old downtown neighborhoods of Bunker Hill and Chavez Ravine. Ordinary working folks rubbed elbows with petty criminals, grifters, and all sorts of women at foggy end-of-the-line outposts in Venice Beach and Santa Monica.</p> <p>Rich with the essence and character of the times, suffused with the patois of the city's underclass, these are stories about the common people of Los Angeles, "a sunny place for shady people," and the strange things that happen to them. Musicians, gun shop owners, streetwalkers, tailors, door-to-door salesmen, drifters, housewives, dentists, pornographers, new arrivals, and hard-bitten denizens all intersect in cleverly plotted stories that center around some kind of shadowy activity. This quirky love letter to a lost way of life will appeal to fans of hard-boiled fiction and anyone interested in the city itself.</p> <p>"Taken as a whole, this collection offers a panoramic view of a rapidly changing Los Angeles and its immigrant communities, rich in period detail and idiomatic dialogue, sometimes based on Cooder's own memories of growing up in the same neighborhoods in which the stories are often set."&#x2014;<em>Uncut Magazine</em></p> <p>"Cooder shouldn't stop making records.

Then King Mabry showed up. Although Tom didn&#x2019;t like the way he looked at Janice, he could see that Mabry made Barker uneasy. So Tom invited Mabry to join them. Tom was right to be worried, because Barker had a plan. He knew that the wagons carried something more than actors and scenery. He and his men were going to steal it any way they could. And that included murder.</p><p>It was a hard land that bred hard men to hard ways. King Mabry survived by his guns. He wasn&#39;t proud of his deadly skill, nor was he ashamed. He just lived with it every hard day on the frontier. When a traveling theatrical troupe hired a ruthless killer to guide them through the Wyoming wilderness, King Mabry--his guns at the ready-set out to follow their trail, and not blizzards, nor Indians, nor the wily guide would stop him.Our foremost storyteller of the American West, <b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour </b>has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and woman who settled the frontier. There are more than three hundred million copies of his books in print around the world.</p><h2>Evening in the Palace of Reason: Bach Meets Frederick the Great in the Age of Enlightenment</h2><p><p>Johann Sebastian Bach created what may be the most celestial and profound body of music in history; Frederick the Great built the colossus we now know as Germany, and along with it a template for modern warfare. Their fleeting encounter in 1757 signals a unique moment in history where belief collided with the cold certainty of reason. Set at the tipping point between the ancient and modern world, <i>Evening in the Palace of Reason</i> captures the tumult of the eighteenth century, the legacy of the Reformation, and the birth of the Enlightenment in this extraordinary tale of two men.</p></p><p><p>A longtime journalist and the former editor of several magazines, including <em>Time</em> and <em>People</em>, James R.

Friends, after all, are the family we choose. But what makes these bonds not just pleasant but essential, and how do they affect our bodies and our minds?</p><p>In <em>Friendship</em>, science journalist Lydia Denworth takes us in search of friendship&#x2019;s biological, psychological, and evolutionary foundations. She finds friendship to be as old as early life on the African savannas&#x2015;when tribes of people grew large enough for individuals to seek fulfillment of their social needs outside their immediate families. Denworth sees this urge to connect reflected in primates, too, taking us to a monkey sanctuary in Puerto Rico and a baboon colony in Kenya to examine social bonds that offer insight into our own. She meets scientists at the frontiers of brain and genetics research and discovers that friendship is reflected in our brain waves, our genomes, and our cardiovascular and immune systems; its opposite, loneliness, can kill. At long last, social connection is recognized as critical to wellness and longevity.</p><p>With insight and warmth, Denworth weaves past and present, field biology and neuroscience, to show how our bodies and minds are designed for friendship across life stages, the processes by which healthy social bonds are developed and maintained, and how friendship is changing in the age of social media. Blending compelling science, storytelling, and a grand evolutionary perspective, Denworth delineates the essential role that cooperation and companionship play in creating human (and nonhuman) societies.</p><p><em>Friendship</em> illuminates the vital aspects of friendship, both visible and invisible, and offers a refreshingly optimistic vision of human nature. It is a clarion call for putting positive relationships at the center of our lives.</p></p><p><strong>Lydia Denworth</strong> is the author of <em>I Can Hear You Whisper</em> and <em>Toxic Truth</em>, and a contributing editor for <em>Scientific American</em> and blogger for <em>Psychology Today</em>. Her work is supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and she lives in Brooklyn, New York.&#x201c;Critical and convincing... Denworth&#x2019;s work achieves the best of science writing by making complicated concepts clear. She uses intelligent observation, empathy, and curiosity to offer a friendship manifesto that will absolutely affect readers' own personal approaches to friendship.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In addition to examining the scientific underpinnings of friendship, Denworth capably demonstrates how loneliness...is truly a health- and life-threatening condition, and there are things to be done to avoid it. Convincing evidence that evolution endowed us with a need for friends, support, comfort, stimulation, and, ultimately, happiness.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Denworth draws several striking conclusions...[<em>Friendship</em>] provide[s] an effective introduction to its subject.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The power of friendship&#x2015;in many ways the most essential of our relationships&#x2015;has long been underestimated. It's an absolute pleasure to see Lydia Denworth do it justice in this lovely, insightful, and important book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Deborah Blum, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>The Poison Squad</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Friendship was once mocked as a naive notion, irrelevant in our species and nonexistent in others. In her lively, personable style, Lydia Denworth reviews what we know about the benefits of close relationships and their long evolutionary history&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Frans de Waal, author of <em>Mama&#x2019;s Last Hug</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The science of friendship has grown remarkably rich in recent years, with scientists studying everything from the chemicals that create bonds in our brains to the friendships animals make for years on end. There's a deep evolutionary story to friendship now, and Lydia Denworth tells it in clear, lyrical prose.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Carl Zimmer, author of <em>She Has Her Mother's Laugh</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A sweeping, precise, and engaging narrative about our primordial capacity for friendship. If you care about what really matters in life, read this fantastic natural history of human friendship.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nicholas A. Christakis, author of <em>Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;I can think of no better rebuke to today&#x2019;s success-obsessed brand of parenting than Denworth&#x2019;s clarion call for friendship. Her convincing narration of the science shows that for our kids to live happily ever after, and successfully too, we must let them spend many more afternoons with friends.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Julie Lythcott-Haims, author of <em>How to Raise an Adult</em></strong></p><h2>The Wisdom of Proverbs, Job and Ecclesiastes</h2><p>&#34;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.&#34; In the Wisdom literature of the Bible we first hear the cool voice of a teacher calling us to think--to think hard and humbly. &#34;How long will fools hate knowledge?&#34; cries Wisdom in the book of Proverbs. Then in Job comes the anguished voice of the questioner, earnest enough to seek answers, honest enough to doubt easy ones. In Ecclesiastes the chastened tone of the Preacher warns of the vanity of all life under the sun. Sensitive to both literary form and theological content, Derek Kidner introduces Proverbs, Job and Ecclesiastes, explaining their basic character and internal structure. He also summarizes and evaluates the wealth of modern criticism focused on each book. Looking at all three books together, Kidner shows how their many voices compare, contrast and ultimately give a unified view of life. Kidner extends his analysis to include Ecclesiasticus and The Wisdom of Solomon from the Apocrapha, and he reprints excerpts from non-Israelite works that parallel the three major books treated.</p><p>The works of Derek Kidner (MA, Christ's College, Cambridge) are full of the marks of both professor and pastor with his even�handed scholarship as well as his devotional insight. These qualities have made his commentaries in the Tyndale Old Testament Commentary series and The Bible Speaks Today series some of the most beloved and popular of recent decades. Kidner had a long career in both the church and the academy in England. He studied at Cambridge University and then served in the ministry for several years before becoming a senior tutor at Oak Hill Theological College. Kidner began his writing career while serving as warden of Tyndale House in Cambridge from 1964 to 1978, publishing his ninth and final book, <em>The Message of Jeremiah,</em> in 1987.</p><h2>Devil&#39;s Cub (The Georgette Heyer Signature Collection)</h2><p><p>"You're in for a treat."&#x2015;<strong>NORA ROBERTS</strong>, #1 <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author </p><p><strong>The Marquis of Vidal always gets his own way.

English Heritage has awarded Georgette Heyer one of their prestigious Blue Plaques, designating her Wimbledon home as the residence of an important figure in British history. She was born in Wimbledon in August 1902. She wrote her first novel, The Black Moth, at the age of seventeen to amuse her convalescent brother; it was published in 1921 and became an instant success. Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. A very private woman, she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or personal life. Her work included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a barrister, and they had one son, Richard.</p><h2>Word 2016 For Dummies</h2><p><b>The bestselling beginner's guide to Microsoft Word</b> <p>Written by the author of the first-ever For Dummies book, Dan Gookin, this new edition of <i>Word For Dummies</i> quickly and painlessly gets you up to speed on mastering the world's number-one word processing software.

The Ferrari poster no longer hung over the blue-striped wallpaper, and the kit I built of the starship Enterprise&#x2014;hardened amberlike droplets of glue visible on the hull&#x2014;no longer sat on the dresser. But it was the same dresser. And it was the same wallpaper. And this was the same single bed.</p><p>Sure, I&#x2019;d spent the night in here a few times over the years, as a visitor. But to be back here as a resident? To be living here? With my parents, and my son, Ethan?</p><p>God, what a fucking state of affairs. How had it come to this?</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t that I didn&#x2019;t know the answer to that question. It was complicated, but I knew.</p><p>The descent had begun five years ago, after my wife, Jan, passed away. A sad story, and not one worth rehashing here. After half a decade, there were things I&#x2019;d had no choice but to put behind me. I&#x2019;d grown into my role of single father. I was raising Ethan, nine years old now, on my own. I&#x2019;m not saying that made me a hero. I&#x2019;m just trying to explain how things unfolded.</p><p>Wanting a new start for Ethan and myself, I quit my job as a reporter for the Promise Falls Standard&#x2014;not that hard a decision, considering the lack of interest by the paper&#x2019;s management in actually covering anything approaching news&#x2014;and accepted an editing position on the city desk at the Boston Globe. The money was better, and Boston had a lot to offer Ethan: the children&#x2019;s museum, the aquarium, Faneuil Hall Marketplace, the Red Sox, the Bruins. If there was a better place for a boy and his dad, I couldn&#x2019;t think where it might be. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>There&#x2019;s always a &#x201c;but.&#x201d;</p><p>But most of my duties as an editor took place in the evening, after reporters had handed in their stories. I could see Ethan off to school, sometimes even pop by and take him to lunch, since I didn&#x2019;t have to be at the paper until three or four in the afternoon. But that meant most nights I did not have dinner with my son. I wasn&#x2019;t there to make sure Ethan spent more time on his homework than video games. I wasn&#x2019;t there to keep him from watching countless episodes of shows about backwoods duck hunters or airheaded wives of equally airheaded sports celebrities or whatever the latest celebration of American ignorance and/or wretched excess happened to be. But the really troubling thing was, I just wasn&#x2019;t there. A lot of being a dad amounts to being around, being available. Not being at work.</p><p>Who was Ethan supposed to talk to if he had a crush on some girl&#x2014;perhaps unlikely at nine, but you never knew&#x2014;or needed advice on dealing with a bully, and it was eight o&#x2019;clock at night? Was he supposed to ask Mrs. Tanaka? A nice woman, no doubt about it, who was happy to make money five nights a week looking after a young boy now that her husband had passed away. But Mrs. Tanaka wasn&#x2019;t much help when it came to math questions. She didn&#x2019;t feel like jumping up and down with Ethan when the Bruins scored in overtime. And it was pretty hard to persuade her to take up a controller and race a few laps around a virtual Grand Prix circuit in one of Ethan&#x2019;s video games.</p><p>By the time I stepped wearily through the door&#x2014;usually between eleven and midnight, and I never went out for drinks after the paper was put to bed because I knew Mrs. Tanaka wanted to return to her own apartment eventually&#x2014;Ethan was usually asleep. I had to resist the temptation to wake him, ask how his day had gone, what he&#x2019;d had for supper, whether he&#x2019;d had any problems with his homework, what he&#x2019;d watched on TV.</p><p>How often had I fallen into bed myself with an aching heart? Telling myself I was a bad father? That I&#x2019;d made a stupid mistake leaving Promise Falls? Yes, the Globe was a better paper than the Standard, but any extra money I was making was more than offset by what was going into Mrs. Tanaka&#x2019;s bank account, and a high monthly rent.</p><p>My parents offered to move to Boston to help out, but I wanted no part of that. My dad, Don, was in his early seventies now, and Arlene, my mother, was only a couple of years behind him. I was not going to uproot them, especially after a recent scare Dad put us all through. A minor heart attack. He was okay now, getting his strength back, taking his meds, but the man was not up to a move. Maybe one day a seniors&#x2019; residence in Promise Falls, when the house became too much for him and Mom to take care of, but moving to a big city a couple of hundred miles away&#x2014;more than three hours if there was traffic&#x2014;was not in the cards.</p><p>So when I heard the Standard was looking for a reporter, I swallowed my pride and made the call.</p><p>I felt like I&#x2019;d eaten a bucket of Kentucky Fried Crow when I called the managing editor and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to come back.&#x201d;</p><p>It was amazing there was actually a position. As newspaper revenues declined, the Standard, like most papers, was cutting back wherever it could. As staff left, they weren&#x2019;t replaced. But the Standard was down to half a dozen people, a number that included reporters, editors, and photographers. (Most reporters were now &#x201c;two-way,&#x201d; meaning they could write stories and take pictures, although in reality, they were more like &#x201c;four-way&#x201d; or &#x201c;six-way,&#x201d; since they also filed for the online edition, did podcasts, tweeted&#x2014;you name it, they did it. It wouldn&#x2019;t be long before they did home delivery to the few subscribers who still wanted a print edition.) Two people had left in the same week to pursue nonjournalistic endeavors&#x2014;one went to public relations, or &#x201c;the dark side,&#x201d; as I had once thought of it, and the other become a veterinarian&#x2019;s assistant&#x2014;so the paper could not provide its usual inadequate coverage of goings-on in Promise Falls. (Little wonder that many people had, for years, been referring to the paper as the Substandard.)</p><p>It would be a shitty place to go back to. I knew that. It wouldn&#x2019;t be real journalism. It would be filling the space between the ads, at least, what ads there were. I&#x2019;d be cranking out stories and rewriting press releases as quickly as I could type them.</p><p>But on the upside, I&#x2019;d be back to working mostly days. I&#x2019;d be able to spend more time with Ethan, and when I did have evening obligations, Ethan&#x2019;s grandparents, who loved him beyond measure, could keep an eye on him.</p><p>The Standard&#x2019;s managing editor offered me the job. I gave my notice to the Globe and my landlord and moved back to Promise Falls. I did move in with my parents, but that was to be a stopgap measure. My first job would be to find a house for Ethan and myself. All I could afford in Boston was a rented apartment, but back here, I&#x2019;d be able to get us a proper home. Real estate prices were in free fall.</p><p>Then everything went to shit at one fifteen p.m. on Monday, my first day back at the Standard.</p><p>I&#x2019;d returned from interviewing some folks who were petitioning for a crosswalk on a busy street before one of their kids got killed, when the publisher, Madeline Plimpton, came into the newsroom.</p><p>&#x201c;I have an announcement,&#x201d; she said, the words catching in her throat. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t be publishing an edition tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>That seemed odd. The next day was not a holiday.</p><p>&#x201c;And we won&#x2019;t be publishing the day after that,&#x201d; Plimpton said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s with a profound sense of sadness that I tell you the Standard is closing.&#x201d;</p><p>She said some more things. About profitability, and the lack thereof. About the decline in advertising, and classifieds in particular. About a drop in market share, plummeting readership. About not being able to find a sustainable business model.</p><p>And a whole lot of other shit.</p><p>Some staff started to cry. A tear ran down Plimpton&#x2019;s cheek, which, to give her the benefit of the doubt, was probably genuine.</p><p>I was not crying. I was too fucking angry. I had quit the goddamn Boston Globe. I&#x2019;d walked away from a decent, well-paying job to come back here. As I went past the stunned managing editor, the man who&#x2019;d hired me, on my way out of the newsroom, I said, &#x201c;Good to know you&#x2019;re in the loop.&#x201d;</p><p>Out on the sidewalk, I got out my cell and called my former editor in Boston. Had the job been filled? Could I return?</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not filling it, David,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>So now here I was, living with my parents.</p><p>No wife.</p><p>No job.</p><p>No prospects.</p><p>Loser.</p><p>It was seven. Time to get up, have a quick shower, wake up Ethan, and get him ready for school.</p><p>I opened the door to his room&#x2014;it used to be a sewing room for Mom, but she&#x2019;d cleared her stuff out when we moved in&#x2014;and said, &#x201c;Hey, pal. Time to get cracking.&#x201d;</p><p>He was motionless under the covers, which obscured all of him but the topsy-turvy blond hair atop his head.</p><p>&#x201c;Rise and shine!&#x201d; I said.</p><p>He stirred, rolled over, pulled down the bedspread enough to see me. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t feel good,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I can go to school.&#x201d;</p><p>I came up alongside the bed, leaned over, and put my hand to his forehead. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t feel hot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s my stomach,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Like the other day?&#x201d; My son nodded. &#x201c;That turned out to be nothing,&#x201d; I reminded him.</p><p>&#x201c;I think this might be different.&#x201d; Ethan let out a small moan.</p><p>&#x201c;Get up and dressed and we&#x2019;ll see how you are then.&#x201d; This was becoming a pattern the last couple of weeks. Whatever ailment was troubling him, it certainly hadn&#x2019;t been troubling him on weekends, when he could down four hot dogs in ten minutes, and had more energy than everyone else in this house combined. Ethan didn&#x2019;t want to go to school, and so far I&#x2019;d been unable to get him to tell me why.</p><p>My parents, who believed sleeping in was staying in bed past five thirty&#x2014;I&#x2019;d heard them getting up as I&#x2019;d stared at that dark ceiling&#x2014;were already in the kitchen when I made my entrance. They&#x2019;d have both had breakfast by this time, and Dad, on his fourth coffee by now, was sitting at the kitchen table, still trying to figure out how to read the news on an iPad tablet, which Mom had bought for him after the Standard stopped showing up at their door every morning.</p><p>He was stabbing at the device with his index finger hard enough to knock it off its stand.</p><p>&#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake, Don,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re not trying to poke its eye out. You just tap it lightly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hate this thing,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s jumping around all over the place.&#x201d;</p><p>Seeing me, Mom adopted the excessively cheerful tone she always used when things were not going well. &#x201c;Hello!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Sleep well?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I lied.</p><p>&#x201c;I just made a fresh pot,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Want a cup?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can manage.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;David, did I tell you about that girl at the checkout at the Walgreens? What was her name? It&#x2019;ll come to me. Anyway, she&#x2019;s cute as a button and she&#x2019;s split up with her husband and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mom, please.&#x201d;</p><p>She was always on the lookout, trying to find someone for me. It was time, she liked to say. Ethan needed a mother. I&#x2019;d grieved long enough, she was forever reminding me.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t grieving.</p><p>I&#x2019;d had six dates in the last five years, with six different women. Slept with one. That was it. Losing Jan, and the circumstances around her death, had made me averse to commitment, and Mom should have understood that.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying,&#x201d; she persisted, &#x201c;that I think she&#x2019;d be pretty receptive if you were to ask her out. Whatever her name is. Next time we&#x2019;re in there together, I&#x2019;ll point her out.&#x201d;</p><p>Dad spoke up. &#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake, Arlene, leave him alone. And come on. He&#x2019;s got a kid and no job. That doesn&#x2019;t exactly make him a great prospect.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good to have you in my corner, Dad,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>He made a face, went back to poking at his tablet. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why the hell I can&#x2019;t get an honest-to-God goddamn paper to my door. Surely there are still people who want to read an actual paper.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re all old,&#x201d; Mom told him.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, old people are entitled to the news,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>I opened the fridge, rooted around until I&#x2019;d found the yogurt Ethan liked, and a jar of strawberry jam. I set them on the counter and brought down a box of cereal from the cupboard.</p><p>&#x201c;They can&#x2019;t make money anymore,&#x201d; Mom told him. &#x201c;All the classifieds went to craigslist and Kijiji. Isn&#x2019;t that right, David?&#x201d;</p><p>I said, &#x201c;Mmm.&#x201d; I poured some Cheerios into a bowl for Ethan, who I hoped would be down shortly. I&#x2019;d wait till he showed before pouring on milk and topping it with a dollop of strawberry yogurt. I dropped two slices of white Wonder bread, the only kind my parents had ever bought, into the toaster.</p><p>My mother said, &#x201c;I just put on a fresh pot. Would you like a cup?&#x201d;</p><p>Dad&#x2019;s head came up.</p><p>I said, &#x201c;You just asked me that.&#x201d;</p><p>Dad said, &#x201c;No, she didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked at him. &#x201c;Yes, she did, five seconds ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then&#x201d;&#x2014;with real bite in his voice&#x2014;&#x201c;maybe you should answer her the first time so she doesn&#x2019;t have to ask you twice.&#x201d;</p><p>Before I could say anything, Mom laughed it off. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d forget my head if it wasn&#x2019;t screwed on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the one who lost his goddamn wallet. What a pain in the ass it was getting that all sorted out.&#x201d;</p><p>Mom poured some coffee into a mug and handed it to me with a smile. &#x201c;Thanks, Mom.&#x201d; I leaned in and gave her a small kiss on her weathered cheek as Dad went back to stabbing at the tablet.</p><p>&#x201c;I wanted to ask,&#x201d; she said to me, &#x201c;what you might have on for this morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why? What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I mean, if you have some job interviews lined up, I don&#x2019;t want to interfere with that at all or&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mom, just tell me what it is you want.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to impose,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only if you have time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake, Mom, just spit it out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk to your mother that way,&#x201d; Dad said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d do it myself, but if you were going out, I have some things I wanted to drop off for Marla.&#x201d;</p><p>Marla Pickens. My cousin. Younger than me by a decade. Daughter of Mom&#x2019;s sister, Agnes.</p><p>&#x201c;Sure, I can do that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I made up a chili, and I had so much left over, I froze some of it, and I know she really likes my chili, so I froze a few single servings in some Glad containers. And I picked her up a few other things. Some Stouffer&#x2019;s frozen dinners. They won&#x2019;t be as good as homemade, but still. I don&#x2019;t think that girl is eating. It&#x2019;s not for me to comment, but I don&#x2019;t think Agnes is looking in on her often enough. And the thing is, I think it would be good for her to see you. Instead of us old people always dropping by. She&#x2019;s always liked you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ever since this business with the baby, she just hasn&#x2019;t been right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x201d; I opened the refrigerator. &#x201c;You got any bottles of water I can put with Ethan&#x2019;s lunch?&#x201d;</p><p>Dad uttered an indignant, &#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; I knew where this was going. I should have known better than to have asked. &#x201c;Biggest scam in the world, bottled water. What comes out of the tap is good enough for anybody. This town&#x2019;s water is fine, and I should know. Only suckers pay for it. Next thing you know, they&#x2019;ll find a way to make you pay for air.

News of Gettysburg and Vicksburg electrified the North and devastated the South. Sandwiched geographically between those victories and lost in the heady tumult of events was news that William S. Rosecrans&#x2019;s Army of the Cumberland had driven Braxton Bragg&#x2019;s Army of Tennessee entirely out of Middle Tennessee. The brilliant campaign nearly cleared the state of Rebels and changed the calculus of the Civil War in the Western Theater. Despite its decisive significance, few readers even today know of these events. The publication of Tullahoma: The Forgotten Campaign that Changed the Course of Civil War, June 23 - July 4, 1863 by award-winning authors David A. Powell and Eric J. Wittenberg, forever rectifies that oversight.<br><br>On June 23, 1863, Rosecrans, with some 60,000 men, initiated a classic campaign of maneuver against Bragg&#x2019;s 40,000. Confronted with rugged terrain and a heavily entrenched foe, Rosecrans intended to defeat Bragg through strategy rather than bloodshed by outflanking him and seizing control of Bragg&#x2019;s supply line, the Nashville &amp; Chattanooga Railroad, at Tullahoma and thus force him to fight a battle outside of his extensive earthworks. It almost worked.<br><br>The complex and fascinating campaign included deceit, hard marching, fighting, and incredible luck&#x2014;both good and bad. Rosecrans executed a pair of feints against Guy&#x2019;s Gap and Liberty Gap to deceive the Rebels into thinking the main blow would fall somewhere other than where it was designed to strike. An ineffective Confederate response exposed one of Bragg&#x2019;s flanks&#x2014;and his entire army&#x2014;to complete disaster. Torrential rains and consequential decisions in the field wreaked havoc on the best-laid plans. Still Bragg hesitated, teetering on the brink of losing the second most important field army in the Confederacy. The hour was late and time was short, and his limited withdrawal left the armies poised for a climactic engagement that may have decided the fate of Middle Tennessee, and perhaps the war. Finally fully alert to the mortal threat facing him, Bragg pulled back from the iron jaws of defeat about to engulf him and retreated&#x2014;this time all the way to Chattanooga, the gateway to the rest of the Southern Confederacy.<br><br>Powell and Wittenberg mined hundreds of archival and firsthand accounts to craft a splendid study of this overlooked campaign that set the stage for the Battles of Chickamauga and Chattanooga, the removal of Rosecrans and Bragg from the chessboard of war, the elevation of U.S. Grant to command all Union armies, and the early stages of William T. Sherman&#x2019;s Atlanta Campaign. Tullahoma&#x2014;one of the most brilliantly executed major campaigns of the war&#x2014;was pivotal to Union success in 1863 and beyond. And now readers everywhere will know precisely why.</p><p>David A. Powell is a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute (1983) with a BA in history. He has published numerous articles in various magazines, and more than fifteen historical simulations of different battles. For the past decade, David&#x2019;s focus has been on the epic battle of Chickamauga, and he is nationally recognized for his tours of that important battlefield.

But with the murder of the commune&#39;s leaders, the rumor-mill goes into overdrive. In trying to solve those murders, Chief Inspector Barnaby is less excited than exasperated. The residents of the Windhorse commune may have been seeking the simple life, but they&#39;re all concealing complicated pasts?or past lives. As in Death of a Hollow Man, Graham is at her most gleeful when skewering the eccentricities of a closed community, and no one survives unscathed.</p><p>Caroline Graham was born in Warwickshire, England. Her first Inspector Barnaby novel, &#34;The Killings at Badger&#39;s Drift&#34;, was selected as one of the Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time by the Crime Writers&#39; Association.Critics place Caroline Graham among writers of classic mysteries like Agatha Christie. But this story is so dense with rich characterizations as to seem a new genre. Graham nests her murder plots in gentle social satire; this one pokes affectionate fun at the fringes of mysticism and New Age cults. But her characters are not stereotypes; each flawed and foolish one finds a different way to tug at the reader&#39;s heartstrings. Hugh Ross&#39;s performance adds luster to an already sparkling book. His narration sounds delightfully spontaneous, and his mildly exaggerated vocal characterizations (including a bravura turn as the Valkyric cello-playing priestess) perfectly match the author&#39;s style. Wonderfully written, wonderfully read! S.P.

Over the course of 172 pages, I have taken all the great material in the first ed, and added to it a series of recipes and procedures which are very low profile and stunningly effective.<br> This treasure trove of information features the Hardware Store Nitro recipe, fuel/air explosives, butt kicking ammonium nitrate formulations, nitromethane mixtures and a vastly improved detonator section.<br> The fun doesn't stop there either.

Candidates for baptism in the ancient Church were trained in prayer, a practice that gave rise to a tradition of commentary on the Lord&#39;s Prayer. These classic texts became the starting points for many other commentaries. Of the three, however, only the discourse of Cyprian is an address to catechumens. Tertullian&#39;s treatise contains additional material on the conduct of worship and on prayer in the assembly, and Origen&#39;s commentary is a vast work on the whole subject of prayer, as much suited to advanced learners in the school of Christ as to those preparing for baptism. All these texts remain spiritually vital, but since they are addressed to a different world, the translator has provided brief notes on points of difficulty and accessible yet scholarly introductions to make these rich works available to a fresh audience.</p><p><p>Alistair Stewart-Sykes, a leading scholar of Christian liturgical origins, is the author of three books on early Christian liturgy and is Vicar in the Diocese of Salisbury, England.</p></p><h2>The Entrepreneur&#39;s Guide to Customer Development: A cheat sheet to The Four Steps to the Epiphany</h2><p>&#x201c;This is a must read for all startups and stakeholders.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014; <b>Steve Blank</b>, author of The 4 Steps to the Epiphany, creator of <b>Customer Development</b> methodology <br><br> &#x201c;The Entrepreneur&#x2019;s Guide is an easy read.

We are deeply concerned with the unprecedented destruction of our Mother Earth, the atrocities of war, the global scourge of poverty, the prevailing culture of materialism, the epidemics that threaten the health of the Earth&#x2019;s peoples, and with the destruction of indigenous ways of life.</i> <br><br> <i>We, the International Council of Thirteen Indigenous Grandmothers, believe that our ancestral ways of prayer, peacemaking, and healing are vitally needed today. . . . We believe that the teachings of our ancestors will light our way through an uncertain future.</i><br> In some Native American societies, tribal leaders consulted a council of grandmothers before making any major decisions that would affect the whole community. What if we consulted our wise women elders about the problems facing our global community today? This book presents the insights and guidance of thirteen indigenous grandmothers from five continents, many of whom are living legends among their own peoples. The Grandmothers offer wisdom on such timely issues as nurturing our families; cultivating physical and mental health; and confronting violence, war, and poverty. Also included are the reflections of Western women elders, including Alice Walker, Gloria Steinem, Helena Norberg-Hodge, and Carol Moseley Brown.</p><p>Carol Schaefer is a writer, editor, journalist, and photographer who has appeared on <i>Good Morning America</i>, CNN, and MSNBC.

This book provides the most complete and accurate assessment of the probability of conflict between the United States and the rising Asian superpower. Equally important, it lays out an in-depth analysis of the possible pathways to peace. Written like a geopolitical detective story, the narrative encourages reader interaction by starting each chapter with an intriguing question that often challenges conventional wisdom.Based on interviews with more than thirty top experts, the author highlights a number of disturbing facts about China&#39;s recent military buildup and the shifting balance of power in Asia: the Chinese are deploying game-changing &#34;carrier killer&#34; ballistic missiles; some of America&#39;s supposed allies in Europe and Asia are selling highly lethal weapons systems to China in a perverse twist on globalization; and, on the U.S. side, debilitating cutbacks in the military budget send a message to the world that America is not serious about its &#34;pivot to Asia.&#34;In the face of these threatening developments, the book stresses the importance of maintaining US military strength and preparedness and strengthening alliances, while warning against a complacent optimism that relies on economic engagement, negotiations, and nuclear deterrence to ensure peace.Accessible to readers from all walks of life, this multidisciplinary work blends geopolitics, economics, history, international relations, military doctrine, and political science to provide a better understanding of one of the most vexing problems facing the world.</p><p><b>Peter Navarro</b> is a professor at the Merage School of Business at the University of California-Irvine.

From brewing tensions in the East and South China Seas and frightening moves in the all-so-stealthy cyberarena, to Beijing's development of specific weapons platforms that challenge Washington's ability to respond to a crisis in Asia, Navarro spells out in one easy-to-read volume all you need to know when it comes to China's provocative challenge to the status quo. It is a must read.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2015;Harry J. Kazianis, executive editor, National Interest, and senior fellow for defense policy, Center for the National Interest&#x201c;Crouching Tiger brings a rare, balanced, and brilliant&nbsp;perspective to the most formidable strategic challenge facing America&#x2015;how to manage Beijing's attempt to create a &#x2018;new Chinese order.'&nbsp;Navarro's fact-based analysis strips bare this troubling issue even as he brings in the most eminent scholars in the field to offer a way forward. At stake are the principles that have stabilized Asia and guided world development for more than half a century.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2015;Stefan Halper, director of American Studies,&nbsp;University of Cambridge, and author of The Beijing Consensus: Legitimizing Authoritarianism in Our Time&nbsp;&#x201c;Navarro makes a compelling case that trouble lies ahead in Asia, mainly because China is going to attempt to dominate that region the way the United States dominates the Western Hemisphere. China, in other words, is going to imitate Uncle Sam.&nbsp;Crouching Tiger&nbsp;is not only clearly and concisely written, but it also addresses almost every issue related to the question of whether China can rise peacefully. And that includes the counterarguments to Navarro's position. This book is ideally suited for a wide audience.&#x201d;&#x2015;John J. Mearsheimer, R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science, University of Chicago&nbsp;&#x201c;Finally, a book that vividly illustrates how China's relentless mercantilist attack on America's industrial and technological bases is not just costing us millions of good-paying jobs, it also now threatens our very national security.

Posing forty-five salient questions, Navarro deputizes his readers to join his step-by-step&nbsp;Sherlockian investigation into whether it is possible&#x2015;and&nbsp;ultimately why it is important to try&#x2015;to avoid conflict with China.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2015;Patrick M.

David Kilgour, JD, former Canadian Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific&#x201c;Crouching Tiger weaves together history, economics, geopolitics, ancient Chinese doctrines, and modern military strategy to assess the challenge of China's military rise and its one-hundred-year quest for global supremacy.&nbsp;It should be read by everyone, from Pentagon strategists and members of Congress to American citizens and taxpayers.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2015;Michael Pillsbury, director, Center on Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute; member, the Council on Foreign Relations and the International Institute for Strategic Studies; and author, The Hundred-Year Marathon: China's Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower&nbsp;&#x201c;Peter Navarro's provocative study thinks the unthinkable: a great power war between the United States and China in the not-so-distant future.&nbsp;Navarro systematically examines the underlying causes, the immediate triggers, and the possible trajectories of such a hypothetical conflict.&nbsp;In the process, he drives home the imperative to keep the peace through American strength.&nbsp;What sets this book apart from the booming literature on China's rise is its appeal to the wider public.&nbsp;By drawing attention to the risks of a Sino-American strategic rivalry, Navarro's work should spur much-needed debate on one of the most consequential challenges facing the United States.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2015;Toshi Yoshihara, John A. van Beuren Chair of Asia-Pacific Studies, US Naval War College, and coauthor, Red Star over the Pacific: China's Rise and the Challenge to US Maritime Strategy</p><h2>Care and Feeding of Sprites (The Spiderwick Chronicles)</h2><p><b> Got Sprites? </b> <br> <br> Many would have you believe that sprites (or "fairies" as they're often called) are sweet and pretty and ultimately peaceful creatures.

And I have no doubt that they will do it." </p><p>The two men are walking down Pennsylvania Avenue, on their way back to the War Department for their second meeting of the day. Lincoln wants a short session with Stanton to discuss the fate of a Confederate ringleader who very recently made the mistake of crossing the border from Canada back into the United States. Stanton is in favor of arresting the man, while Lincoln prefers to let him slip away to England on the morning steamer. As soon as Lincoln makes his point, he aims to hurry back to the White House for the carriage ride he promised Mary. </p><p>William Crook is fond of the president and deeply unsettled by the comments. </p><p>"Why do you think so, Mr. President?" </p><p>Crook steps forward as they come upon a group of angry drunks. He puts his body between theirs and Lincoln's, thus clearing the way for the president's safe passage. Crook's actions, while brave, are unnecessary&#x2014;if the drunks realize that the president of the United States is sharing the same sidewalk, they give no notice. </p><p>Lincoln waits until Crook is beside him again, then continues his train of thought. "Other men have been assassinated," Lincoln says. </p><p>"I hope you are mistaken, Mr. President." </p><p>"I have perfect confidence in those around me. In every one of you men. I know that no one could do it and escape alive," Lincoln says. The two men walk in silence before he finishes his thought: "But if it is to be done, it is impossible to prevent it." </p><p>At the War Department, Lincoln once again invites Stanton and telegraph chief Major Thomas Eckert, the man who can break fireplace pokers over his arms, to attend Our American Cousin that night. Both men turn him down once again. Lincoln is upset by their rejection, but he doesn't show it outwardly. The only indication comes on the walk back to the White House, when he admits to Crook, "I do not want to go." Lincoln says it like a man facing a death sentence. </p><p>Inside the White House, Lincoln is pulled into an unscheduled last-minute meeting that will delay his carriage ride. Lincoln hides his exasperation and dutifully meets with New Hampshire congressman Edward H. Rollins. But as soon as Rollins leaves, yet another petitioner begs a few minutes of Lincoln's time. A weary Lincoln, all too aware that Mary will be most upset if he keeps her waiting much longer, gives former military aide Colonel William Coggeshall the benefit of a few moments. </p><p>Finally, Lincoln marches down the stairs and heads for the carriage. He notices a one-armed soldier standing off to one side of the hallway and overhears the young man tell another, "I would almost give my other hand if I could shake that of Lincoln." </p><p>Lincoln can't resist. "You shall do that and it shall cost you nothing, boy," he exclaims, smiling broadly as he walks over and grasps the young man's hand. He asks his name, that of his regiment, and in which battle he lost the arm. </p><p>Only then does Lincoln say his farewells and step outside. He finds Mary waiting at the carriage. She's in a tentative mood&#x2014;they've spent so little time alone in the past few months that being together, just the two of them, feels strange. She wonders if Lincoln might be more comfortable if they brought some friends along for the open-air ride. </p><p>"I prefer to ride by ourselves today," he insists. Lincoln helps her into the barouche and then is helped up from the gravel driveway to take his seat beside her. The four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage features two facing double seats for passengers and a retractable roof. The driver sits in a box seat up front. Lincoln opts to keep the roof open, then covers their laps with a blanket, even though the temperature is a warm sixty-eight degrees. </p><p>The war has been hard on their marriage. Mary is delighted beyond words to see that Lincoln is in a lighthearted mood. She gazes into her husband's eyes and recognizes the man who once courted her. </p><p>"Dear Husband," she laughs, "you startle me by your great cheerfulness. I have not seen you so happy since before Willie's death." </p><p>"And well I may feel so, Mary. I consider this day, the war has come to a close." The president pauses. "We must both be more cheerful in the future&#x2014;between the war and the loss of our darling Willie we have been very miserable." </p><p>Coachman Francis Burns guides the elegant pair of black horses down G Street. The pace is a quick trot. Behind them ride two cavalry escorts, just for safety. The citizens of Washington are startled to see the Lincolns out on the town. They hear loud laughter from Mary as the barouche passes by and see a grin spread across the president's face. When a group calls out to him as the carriage turns onto New Jersey Avenue, he doffs his trademark stovepipe hat in greeting. </p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;<p></p><p>Throughout the war, Lincoln has stayed in the moment, never allowing himself to dream of the future. But now he pours his heart out to Mary, talking about a proposed family trip to Palestine, for he is most curious about the Holy Land. And after he leaves office he wants the family to return to their roots in Illinois, where he will once again hang out his shingle as a country lawyer. The "Lincoln &amp; Herndon" sign has never been taken down, at Lincoln's specific request to his partner. </p><p>"Mary," Lincoln says, "we have had a hard time of it since we came to Washington, but the war is over, and with God's blessing we may hope for four years of peace and happiness, and then we will go back to Illinois and pass the rest of our lives in quiet. We have laid by some money, and during this term we will try to save up more." </p><p>The carriage makes its way to the Navy Yard, where Lincoln steps on board USS Montauk. His intent is just a cursory peek at the storied ironclad, with its massive round turret constituting the deck's superstructure. But soon its crew mobs Lincoln, and he is forced to politely excuse himself so that he can return to Mary. Unbeknownst to Lincoln, the Montauk will soon serve another purpose. </p><p>Lincoln offers a final salute to the many admirers as coachman Burns turns the carriage back toward the White House. It's getting late, and the Lincolns have to be at the theater. </p><p>John Wilkes Booth is expecting them. <br></p><p><br>Copyright � 2011 by Bill O'Reilly</p></p><h2>Iola Leroy (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b> A landmark account of the African American experience during the Civil War and its aftermath </b> <br><br> First published in 1892, this stirring novel by the great writer and activist Frances Harper tells the story of the young daughter of a wealthy Mississippi planter who travels to the North to attend school, only to be sold into slavery in the South when it is discovered that she has Negro blood.

A major challenge is how to structure the firm s environment so that it attains the speed and low cost of high-volume flow lines while retaining the flexibility and customization potential of a low-volume job shop.<p> The book's three parts are organized according to three categories of skills required by managers and engineers: basics, intuition, and synthesis. Part I reviews traditional operations management techniques and identifies the necessary components of the science of manufacturing. Part II presents the core concepts of the book, beginning with the structure of the science of manufacturing and a discussion of the systems approach to problem solving. Other topics include behavioral tendencies of manufacturing plants, push and pull production systems, the human element in operations management, and the relationship between quality and operations. Chapter conclusions include main points and observations framed as manufacturing laws. In Part III, the lessons of Part I and the laws of Part II are applied to address specific manufacturing management issues in detail. The authors compare and contrast common problems, including shop floor control, long-range aggregate planning, workforce planning, and capacity management. A main focus in Part III is to help readers visualize how general concepts in Part II can be applied to specific problems.</p><p> Written for both engineering and management students, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of a rule-based and data driven approach to operations planning and control. They advance an organized framework from which to evaluate management practices and develop useful intuition about manufacturing systems.</p><p> Titles of related interest also from Waveland Press: Hopp, <i>Supply Chain Science</i> (ISBN 9781577667384) and Nahmias-Olsen, <i>Production and Operations Analysis,</i> Seventh Edition (ISBN 9781478623069). </p><p> Table of Contents 0.

For grades 3 and 4. --Lunar &amp; Planetary Information Bulletin, Lunar &amp; Planetary Institute; Issue 109; February 2007<br><br>When the Soviet Union launched the first satellite into space in 1957, many Americans felt let down. They wanted to see their country make a mark in the field of space exploration too. America made its first major space breakthrough in 1961 when Alan Shepherd became the first American and second human to go into space. President Kennedy was keen to see America do something important in what came to be called the race into space, and later in 1961, in a speech to Congress, Kennedy expressed his hope that America would land a man on the moon before the end of the decade. By December 1968, NASA had managed to get astronauts around the moon and back in the Apollo 8 mission. It was an enormous achievement and it was decided that if Apollo Missions 9 and 10 went well, NASA would attempt a moon landing. Both missions went perfectly and Apollo 11 was scheduled for July 1969. Thus it was that Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin, and Neil Armstrong were ready and well rehearsed when they climbed aboard their spacecraft on July 16th, 1969. Five hundred million people around&nbsp; he world people watched as the Saturn V rocket blasted off at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. On July 20th Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first people to walk on the moon and history was made. This book will give young readers a very real picture of what took place before, during, and after the historic first moon landing. Readers will see that there was a quite a rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States which drove both countries to try to outdo one another in the race into space. An easy to follow text presented in a graphic novel format rich with illustrations makes this the prefect book for readers who prefer books with lots of artwork. This is one of large collection of titles in the Graphic Library series published by Capstone Press. --Through the Looking Glass Childrens Book Review, June 2007<br><br>This addition to Capstones Graphic Library series presents the drama of the first moon landing, complete with authentic astronaut-mission control talk and detailed illustrations, and a map at the back showing the locations of the six moon landings. Makes me want to go bust out the telescope to see if I can get a closeup of the landing sites. My one issue with this book, and maybe it couldnt really be avoided given the times and the subject matter, but in the whole book there are only two women portrayed, both mothers at home on the living room sofa with husband and son, making rather shallow observations of what theyre watching on TV. Could the moms not have made the science-based answers to their sons questions? And why isnt one of these kids a girl? Other than that gender bias, this is a great book and will certainly be a popular resource for students learning about the early years of the Unites States space program. --Smart Writers Journal, October 2006</p><h2>Communion with the Triune God</h2><p><p>Does it make a difference that the God Christians claim to worship has revealed himself as triune-the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit? Does this fundamental truth of biblical authority have an effect on a believer's personal fellowship with God?</p><p>Puritan theologian John Owen recognized the great need for every believer to understand the triune God. Communion with the Triune God revisits the truth presented by John Owen and challenges all believers to truly recognize and appreciate the ministry that God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit have in their lives. This work of John Owen encourages Christians to enjoy true communion with each person of the triune God.</p></p><p><p><strong>Kelly M.

And Communion with the Triune God is his most extraordinary effort. No one else has laid open the paths of personal fellowship with the three persons of the Trinity the way Owen does.

Race and ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality are all staple ingredients in this conversation. They are salient aspects of social being from which economic practices, political policies, and popular discourses create "Americans." Because all of these facets of social being have such significant meaning on a national scale, they also have major consequences for both individuals and groups in terms of their success and well-being, as well as how they perceive themselves socially and politically.<p>The history of Jews in the United States is one of racial change that provides useful insights on race in America. Prevailing classifications have sometimes assigned Jews to the white race and at other times have created an off-white racial designation for them. Those changes in racial assignment have shaped the ways American Jews of different eras have constructed their ethnoracial identities. Brodkin illustrates these changes through an analysis of her own family's multi-generational experience. She shows how Jews experience a kind of double vision that comes from racial middleness: on the one hand, marginality with regard to whiteness; on the other, whiteness and belonging with regard to blackness.</p><p>Class and gender are key elements of race-making in American history. Brodkin suggests that this country's racial assignment of individuals and groupsconstitutes an institutionalized system of occupational and residential segregation, is a key element in misguided public policy, and serves as a pernicious foundational principle in the construction of nationhood. Alternatives available to non-white and alien "others" have been either to whiten or to be consigned to an inferior underclass unworthy of full citizenship. The American ethnoracial map-who is assigned to each of these poles-is continually changing, although the binary of black and white is not. As a result, the structure within which Americans form their ethnoracial, gender, and class identities is distressingly stable. Brodkin questions the means by which Americans construct their political identities and what is required to weaken the hold of this governing myth.</p></p><p>The history of Jews in the United States is one of racial change that provides useful insights on race in America.

From that day forward, along the ragged ridges of the West Virginia-Kentucky line, the Hatfields and the McCoys have operated not withing the law but within mountain codes of their own making. In 1882, when Fanny's sister Roseanna runs off with young Johnse Hatfield, the hatred between the two clans explodes.<br>As the killings, abductions, raids, and heartbreak escalate bitterly and senselessly, Fanny, the sole voice of reason, realizes that she is powerless to stop the fighting and must learn to rise above the petty natures of her family and neighbors to find her own way out of the hatred. <br></p><p>Feuds among the mountain folks of West Virginia and Kentucky, particularly the bloody skirmishes between the Hatfield and McCoy families, are often celebrated in American legend and folksongs. In <i>The Coffin Quilt</i>, Ann Rinaldi mines this rich vein of Americana for a fascinating tale that closely follows the real events of the Hatfield-McCoy feud, but which also has implications for our own violent times. Rinaldi--known for <i>Cast Two Shadows</i>, <i>An Acquaintance with Darkness</i>, and other historical fiction novels for teens--suggests in her author's note that "the Civil War conditioned men who fought in it to kill and to hate." Consequently, men came home from the war to their mountains with minds and rifles primed to react to the slightest trespass upon their exaggerated loyalty to kinfolk. The story is told by Fanny, the youngest of the fourteen McCoy children, who traces the beginnings of the famous feud to a confused Civil War shooting and a dispute over a herd of pigs. When her favorite older sister, the beautiful Roseanna, runs off with handsome Johnse Hatfield, it's like a bucket of gasoline thrown on the smoldering hatred between the two families. Warned by the apparition she calls Yeller Thing, Fanny is nonetheless a helpless witness to ambushes and killings, burials and retribution. Too late she realizes that Roseanna's obsession with sewing a traditional but gruesome coffin-decorated quilt is a sign of her evil attraction to deliberately stoking the fires of the feud--providing a psychological thriller ending for this dramatic tale of hillbilly love and revenge.

It embraces all beings without exception. When altruistic love encounters suffering, it becomes compassion, which springs from the same benevolence, but more specifically wishes that beings may be free from suffering and from the many possible causes of suffering.

They offer invaluable insights into the way our minds creates our reality and how we can wake up to what leads to suffering and what can bring us happiness and peace of mind. <em>Mindful Compassion</em> is an illuminating, readable, and necessary background of Western and Buddhist understanding that will support and deepen the current application of mindfulness.

Consider the Reelfoot scarp in Tennessee: to the casual observer it is nothing more than a slight rise in a farm field. Yet this subtle slope represents a rift formed during an 1812 earthquake that forced the mighty Mississippi to flow upstream.

Why do we yell at our laptops? And why do people like to say, &#x201c;Everything happens for a reason&#x201d;? Drawing on cognitive science, anthropology, and neuroscience, Matthew Hutson shows us that magical thinking is not only hardwired into our brains&#x2014;it&#x2019;s been a factor in our evolutionary success. Magical thinking helps us believe that we have free will and an underlying purpose as it protects us from the paralyzing awareness of our own mortality. Interweaving entertaining stories, personal reflections, and sharp observations, <i>The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking</i> reveals just how this seemingly irrational process informs and improves the lives of even the most hardened skeptics.</p><p>7 REASONS TO READ <em>The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking</em><br><br>1: "Matthew Hutson promises to convince the most hard-core skeptics and rationalists that they believe in magic, and he succeeds&#x2014;with wit and clarity and scientific rigor."&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;SHARON BEGLEY, author of <em>Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain</em>&nbsp;<br><br>2: "A remarkably creative synthesis of the science behind magical thinking threaded through with a very personal narrative that engages the reader."&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;BRUCE HOOD, PH.D., author of <em>SuperSense</em> and <em>The Self Illusion&nbsp;</em><br><br>3: "With wit and respect for both the rational and the irrational, Hutson reveals the pervasiveness of superstition and 'magical thinking,' even among people who consider themselves totally rational."&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;ALAN LIGHTMAN, PH.D., author of <em>Einstein's Dreams&nbsp;</em><br><br>4: "This is a book that you pick up but can't put down.

Our negative states of mind, such as uncontrolled desire and anger, create endless problems for ourselves and others, and prevent us from fulfilling our deepest wishes. Geshe Kelsang begins by presenting Buddha's popular teaching on the Four Noble Truths, which offers a clear and simple solution to all our problems, guiding us to an oasis of peace within our hearts. He then focuses in particular on overcoming the problem of anger, learning how to develop and maintain patience when faced with even the most difficult circumstances.</p></p><p>The instructions given in this book are methods for improving our human nature and qualities through developing the capacity of our mind. In recent years our knowledge of modern technology has increased considerably, and as a result we have witnessed remarkable material progress, but there has not been a corresponding increase in human happiness. There is no less suffering in the world today and there are no fewer problems. It could even be said that there are now more problems and greater dangers than ever before. This shows that the cause of happiness and the solution to our problems do not lie in knowledge of material things. Happiness and suffering are states of mind, and so their main causes cannot be found outside the mind. If we want to be truly happy and free from suffering, we must learn how to control our mind.<p>Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso is a fully accomplished meditation master and internationally renowned teacher of Buddhism who has pioneered the introduction of modern Buddhism into contemporary society. He is the author of 22 highly acclaimed books that transmit perfectly the ancient wisdom of Buddhism to our modern world. He has also founded over 1200 Kadampa Buddhist Centers and groups throughout the world. </p> <p>In his teachings, Geshe Kelsang emphasizes the importance of meditation and how to apply it in daily life. He reveals practical methods for developing wisdom, cultivating a good heart and maintaining a peaceful mind through which we can all find true and lasting happiness. Demonstrating these qualities perfectly in his own life, Geshe Kelsang has dedicated his whole life to helping others find inner peace and happiness.</p><p></p></p><h2>The Elephant Man: A Play</h2><p>&#34;The Elephant Man&#34; is based on the life of John Merrick, who lived in London during the latter part of the nineteenth century. A horribly deformed young man, who has been a freak attraction in traveling side shows, is found abandoned and helpless and is admitted for observation to Whitechapel, a prestigious London hospital. Under the care of a famous young doctor, who educates him and introduces him to London society, Merrick changes from a sensational object of pity to the urbane and witty favorite of the aristocracy and literati.

Our most distinguished judges should follow the lead of this groundbreaking volume.&#x201d;<br> Justin Driver, <i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>A rare and illuminating view of how judges decide dramatic legal cases&#x2014;<em>Law and Order</em> from behind the bench&#x2014;including the Eli�n Gonz�lez, Terri Schiavo, and Scooter Libby cases</b> <p>Prosecutors and defense attorneys have it easy&#x2014;all they have to do is to present the evidence and make arguments. It&#x2019;s the judges who have the heavy lift: they are the ones who have to make the ultimate decisions, many of which have profound consequences on the lives of the people standing in front of them.</p> <p>In <em>Tough Cases,</em> judges from different kinds of courts in different parts of the country write about the case that proved most difficult for them to decide. Some of these cases received international attention: the Eli�n Gonz�lez case in which Judge Jennifer Bailey had to decide whether to return a seven-year-old boy to his father in Cuba after his mother drowned trying to bring the child to the United States, or the Terri Schiavo case in which Judge George Greer had to decide whether to withdraw life support from a woman in a vegetative state over the wishes of her parents, or the Scooter Libby case about appropriate consequences for revealing the name of a CIA agent. Others are less well-known but equally fascinating: a judge on a Native American court trying to balance U.S. law with tribal law, a young Korean American former defense attorney struggling to adapt to her new responsibilities on the other side of the bench, and the difficult decisions faced by a judge tasked with assessing the mental health of a woman who has killed her own children.</p> <p>Relatively few judges have publicly shared the thought processes behind their decision making. <em>Tough Cases</em> makes for fascinating reading for everyone from armchair attorneys and fans of <em>Law and Order</em> to those actively involved in the legal profession who want insight into the people judging their work.</p></p><p><b>Russell Canan</b> is currently a judge on the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and an adjunct professor at the George Washington University School of Law.

Collards never did make for good eating, but I was wondering if maybe they were some kind of sign that it was time for me to skedaddle. Collards always reminded me of Mama. She used to make me drawing paper out of collards, sumac seeds, dryer lint, and newspaper Daddy chopped up in his wood chipper. She plunked things in her paper the way other people stuck things in scrapbooks. Thread from the hem of her wedding dress, a four-leaf clover, Daddy&#x2019;s first gray hair. Mama&#x2019;s paper held so much life, it made my drawings pop right off the page.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was the kind of mama and daddy I used to have.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was ruffling up those collards, mourning my daddy and scheming on how to sneak away to win back Mama. Not that I had much time for scheming. Aunt Belinda, Little Quinn, Jackson, and Clay were the next aisle over. My cousins were working hard at plowing down every last tower of cans in that store. Aunt Belinda, she was working hard at keeping some distance between her cart and those crashes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Me, I was supposed to be finding Aunt Belinda some hot sauce. She hadn&#x2019;t even started her potato salad or her red velvet cake, and already folks were busy unsnapping folding chairs, setting up for the fry. As in the February Firehouse Jubilee Fish Fry and Red Velvet Cake Cook-Off--the place where Aunt Belinda said she was finally going to land herself a new husband to take the place of Daddy&#x2019;s no-account brother. She already had her sights set on the new fireman, the one with the king-cab truck.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Get your head out of the clouds, Cricket.&#x201d; Aunt Belinda knocked my hand off the collards. So much for signs. &#x201c;Make yourself useful. I need that hot sauce. And call Aunt Fig and find out whether her cake recipe calls for buttermilk or sweet milk.&#x201d; She handed me her cell phone.<br> &nbsp;<br> It came alive with the sound of &#x201c;Love Me Like You Mean It.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Aunt Belinda grabbed back the phone. &#x201c;WOKT Country is my favorite radio station,&#x201d; she chirped.<br> &nbsp;<br> I rolled my eyes. Soon as Aunt Belinda got named a finalist for the Dollywood Trivia Trip of a Lifetime, she&#x2019;d started answering her phone that way so she&#x2019;d win if WOKT called.<br> &nbsp;<br> Aunt Belinda ducked her chin and shuffled two steps back. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t talk now. This coming Wednesday. Got it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She rambled through her purse, found the Post-it note with her to-do list, and scratched down two lines. Slapping the note on top of her purse, she looked at my bangs, not meeting my eyes. &#x201c;Pecans are your favorite, right?&#x201d; She threw a big bag in her cart, the expensive kind, not store brand.<br> &nbsp;<br> My neck hairs went prickly.<br> &nbsp;<br> With money too tight even for dollar-store art supplies, why was Aunt Belinda buying me things all of a sudden? Did she want me to do some more blind-date babysitting? I poked at the bag. &#x201c;Who was that on the phone?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Aunt Belinda just stared at the rutabagas, sucking her cheeks in like she was working on a mint. Finally, she yanked a tube of Wanda&#x2019;s Classy Lady Peach Passion lipstick out of her purse and jerked it across her lips. &#x201c;Never you mind. Now get me that hot sauce. Pronto.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My cousins swarmed up and started prying the bottom okra can out of the pyramid display.<br> &nbsp;<br> Aunt Belinda spun her cart around, and the sticky note flew off her purse.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey, you dropped . . . ,&#x201d; I yelled after her, but she was already speeding toward the meat section.<br> &nbsp;<br> I left the note right where it was. The sooner I found the hot sauce, the sooner we could all get out of the store.<br> &nbsp;<br> But before I even got past the Duke&#x2019;s mayonnaise, I spotted her--a little brown cricket stuck in a spiderweb on the baseboard.<br> &nbsp;<br> The poor thing was trapped even worse than me. She was trying to wiggle out and was tangling herself up worse. The spider skittered close.<br> &nbsp;<br> I snatched that cricket loose.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not fast enough.<br> &nbsp;<br> I saved her from the spider, but Little Quinn swooped in like a duck on a June bug. &#x201c;Look, Clay, Cricket&#x2019;s done found herself a cricket. Maybe they&#x2019;re related.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Twisting away, I studied the bug in my hand. It was probably her and her kin who&#x2019;d been making music in our backyard all last summer.<br> &nbsp;<br> After a minute, she figured out I wasn&#x2019;t going to hurt her none. Her antennae relaxed, and she took a tiny step on legs as thin as embroidery thread. She looked like she was listening for something. Was she hoping for the sound of someone out there calling, calling, calling, and waiting for her to answer back?<br> &nbsp;<br> Maybe I did have more in common with that bug than just a name.<br> &nbsp;<br> The cricket turned her warm brown eyes on me and cocked her head. I swear she saw inside me and asked the same exact question I&#x2019;d been asking myself for days: Just how far will you go to get your mama back?<br> &nbsp;<br> Before I could even think about answering, Little Quinn pulled a firecracker out of his pocket and dug for the matches. &#x201c;Hand her over.&#x201d; He sounded bored. It was just another blowing-things-up Saturday.<br> &nbsp;<br> I kicked him in the shin, not hard enough to leave a bruise he could point at, just enough to get him out of the way. Pulling the cricket in tight, I shot for the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Aunt Belinda wheeled up and pointed at me with a Trans Am&#x2013;red fingernail. &#x201c;Put that nasty thing down and find me that hot sauce.&#x201d; She plopped a loaf of white bread in her cart and cut her eyes toward the store clock, its hands almost at noon. &#x201c;You know they&#x2019;re shutting up early for the fry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Just a minute. I need to . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Aunt Belinda tilted her face toward the greasy ceiling tiles. &#x201c;Lord, please save me from selfish children.&#x201d; Then her voice turned into the one she used when she was trying to get her boys to bed. &#x201c;Just help me out this one time, Cricket. For the fry. Will you do that much?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; I sighed, trying to get out of hearing, for the umpteenth time, all the things Aunt Belinda used to do to help out her family when she was twelve.<br> &nbsp;<br> My cousins swaggered closer, blocking the way to the door. I had to get the cricket out if she was going to make it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Gotta go.&#x201d; I swerved toward the bathroom.<br> &nbsp;<br> The back lights were already off, and I fumbled for the bathroom switch. One tiny window glowed on the rear wall, the glass painted in the same overcooked butter-bean color as the rest of the store. A slice of light showed through the bottom, though, where the window was pushed out. Just big enough for the cricket.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was the good news. The bad news was, the window was too high to reach. A tall trash can stood next to the door. I waltzed it side to side over to the window, holding my breath against the smell of dirty diapers, Comet, and wet brown paper towels.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Cricket, I hope you&#x2019;re grateful,&#x201d; I whispered.<br> &nbsp;<br> She wasn&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;<br> Soon as I opened my fingers to check on her, she sprang onto the lightbulb over the mirror.<br> &nbsp;<br> I wriggled my way onto a sink, prayed the whole thing wouldn&#x2019;t fall off the wall, and tried to coax her loose before she got burned.<br> &nbsp;<br> Instead, she catapulted onto the top of a stall. Balancing on a lopsided toilet seat, I lunged after her. Aunt Belinda was going to kill me for taking so long.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time I finally caught her, we&#x2019;d visited all four toilets once and some two times.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was out of breath and really, really needed to wash my hands.<br> &nbsp;<br> But I&#x2019;ll say one thing for that cricket&#x2014;she had a mind of her own. &#x201c;Names carry a power,&#x201d; Daddy always said. Right then and there, I picked out a good one for her--Charlene. Mama&#x2019;s middle name.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hoisting myself onto the trash can rim, I pushed the window open wider and started to let Charlene out. But instead of clean air, I got slapped with the smell of fresh-poured asphalt from the side parking lot. Charlene would get stuck in the tar. I&#x2019;d have to take her out the front. I eased the bathroom door open.<br> &nbsp;<br> The store was dark, too dark.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was too quiet.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was too empty.<br> &nbsp;<br> It took me about a minute to figure out that the only living creatures in the store were me and that cricket.<br> &nbsp;<br> She stared at me with those question eyes of hers, waiting on me to make the next move.<br><br></p></p><h2>Dark Symphony (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 9)</h2><p><b>In this thrilling novel in the #1 <i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling Carpathian series, Christine Feehan presents the story of&nbsp;one of the oldest Carpathians as he meets the woman meant to be his...<br><br></b>Blinded and scarred in a terrible accident, Antoinetta Scarletti made music that thrilled the world with its beauty and passion.

Muffling the sound of conspiracy. Of murder stalking the night. Of dark, ugly intentions hidden within the white, swirling mists and the deeper shadows. The fog was the perfect cover for the predator as he moved silently across the sky, searching for prey. He had been alone too long, far from his own kind, fighting the insidious call of power, of evil, that whispered to him every waking minute of his existence. </p><p> Far below him were the humans, his prey. His enemies. He knew what they would do to one of his kind, should they discover him. He still woke choking from his slumber, trapped for those first waking moments in his past. His body would always bear the scars of torture, though it was nearly impossible to scar his kind. He was Carpathian, a species as old as time, with tremendous gifts to hold dominion over the weather, the land, even animals. He could shift shape and soar high, run with the wolves, yet without the light to his darkness, he could so easily give in to the whispers of temptation, the call for power, and turn wholly evil. He had the potential for becoming the undead, as so many of his kind had chosen to do. </p><p> He traveled the world, hunting the vampire, seeking to maintain a balance of life in a world of bleak loneliness. Seeking to maintain honor when he felt he'd lost it. And then he heard the music. It was playing on a television set in one of the stores he passed late in the evening, and the music caught him as nothing else had. Ensnared him. Mesmerized him. Wrapped his soul in golden notes until he thought only of the music. He could only hear the music playing in his head. It was so powerful it even dulled the relentless hunger that was ever present in his life. He traveled to Italy, drawn by the music. And he stayed for other, much more compelling reasons. </p><p> He flew across the sky with silent stealth, pulled in the same direction on every awakening. With his acute sense of smell he caught the scent of salt from the sea and the fuel from a boat tossed about on the rolling waves. The wind also brought him the scent of man. For a brief moment his lips drew back in a silent snarl, and he felt his incisors lengthen in hunger. In distaste. Most humans had become his enemy, although he sought their protection. Humans used him as a trap to draw others of his kind, nearly succeeding in killing the life mate to his prince. </p><p> The stain of shame would always be on him. Would always keep him from being completely comfortable in his homeland and with others of his kind. He would never be able to bear their forgiveness. He could not forgive himself. His self-imposed penance had been service to his people. He actively hunted their mortal enemy, the vampire, engaging in battle after battle when he had never been a warrior. He went from country to country in a relentless, merciless hunt, determined to rid the world of the evil stalking his kind. Every kill brought him closer to the edge of madness. Until he found the music. </p><p> The night enfolded him, embraced him as a brother. In the darkness, his eyes glowed the fiery red of a predator on the hunt. Far below him, he glimpsed the lights of the villas dimmed by the thick bank of fog, houses crammed close to one another set precariously on the hillsides. In the distance he could just make out the Scarletti palazzo, a work of art created so many centuries before. </p><p> The music originated there, in the great palazzo. Concertos and operas were composed and played on a perfectly tuned piano. He stayed close by to hear the beauty of the masterpieces created and performed. The notes soothed him and gave him a sense of hope. He had even gone so far as to purchase several CDs and a machine on which to play them, keeping his treasures deep beneath the earth in the lair he kept to be close to the woman he knew belonged to only him. </p><p> Her family knew he was dangerous by looking at him. They sensed the predator in him, but Antonietta thought herself safe with him. And she was the only one he wanted. The one woman he would have. </p><p> Antonietta Scarletti stared blankly toward the elaborate stained glass window of the palazzo. Outside the walls of the villa, the wind shrieked and moaned. She touched the glass with her sensitive fingertips, tracing the lead and the familiar patterns. If she tried, she could remember them, the vivid colors and frightening images. She laughed aloud at the thought. As a child she had certainly been frightened by the gargoyles and demons decorating the fifteenth-century palazzo, now she simply appreciated their beauty, although she could only see them through her fingertips. </p><p> Her home had been modernized many times over the centuries, but the Gothic architecture had been preserved as closely as possible to the original. She loved every secret passageway with the Machiavellian traps and every carefully cut stone that made up her home. Strangely, she was sleepy. Most nights she wandered, wide awake, through the large hallways or played her piano, the music moving through her and onto the keys, to pour out the torrent of emotion that sometimes threatened to overwhelm her. Tonight, as the wind howled and the sea pounded on the cliffs, she plaited her hair into a thick rope and thought of a dark poet. </p><p> Tasha, her cousin, had commented at dinner that threads of gray were already beginning to appear in her mass of long hair. Antonietta knew she was vain about her hair, but it was her only call to glory, and now with the gray beginning to appear, it was only a matter of time before that small vanity would vanish. Her self-mocking laughter was soft as she moved without hesitation across the room, unerringly to the piano. Her fingers slid across the keys, immediately responding to the laughter in her heart. </p><p> She loved her life, blind or no. She lived it the way she wanted to live. Music flowed into the night. A summons. She knew the music called to him. Byron. Antonietta thought of him day and night. A secret obsession she could not get over. The sound of his voice touched her like she imagined his fingers on her skin would. A caress of sound. He was her only regret. Her money and fame allowed her to lead the life she wanted in spite of her loss of sight, but it also provided a barrier between her and every man. Even Byron. Especially Byron. His quiet acceptance, his continuing interest--so completely focused on her--threatened to involve her emotions as well as her body, and that, she couldn't afford. </p><p> Antonietta seated herself at the bench, her body leaden with unexpected fatigue. Her fingers raced over the ivory keys. The music flowed into space, unrequited love, boundless passion unanswered. Heat. Fire. A hunger that would never be sated. Byron, the dark poet. Brooding. Mysterious. A man for fantasies. She had no idea of his age. He often answered the summons of her music. Ever since the day four months earlier when he saved her beloved grandfather from a car accident, he would suddenly appear in the room with her, somehow getting past the security to sit quietly while she played. It was a degree of her obsession that she never questioned him, never asked him how he managed to get into her home, into her music room. </p><p> Antonietta always knew the moment Byron entered the room, although he never made a sound. Her family had no idea how often he came, appearing in the great music room late at night and staying up till all hours with her. He rarely talked, just listened to the music, but sometimes they played chess or discussed books and world affairs. Those were the times she loved best, sitting and listening to the sound of his voice. </p><p> He had courtly, Old World mannerisms and spoke with an accent she couldn't quite place. She imagined him a chivalrous prince coming to call whenever she allowed her girlish imagination to get the better of her. He rarely touched her, but he never objected when she touched him, reading his expressions. He took her breath away each time he came into the same room with her. </p><p> The music swelled beneath her fingers, rose to a crescendo of rioting emotions. Byron. Her grandfather's friend. The rest of her family were wary and on edge around him. Most left the room soon after he entered. They thought him dangerous. Antonietta thought he might be, despite the fact that he was unfailingly gentle with her. She sensed behind Byron's calm exterior a predator hunting. Watching. Waiting. Biding his time. It only added to his allure. The unattainable fantasy. The dangerous, dark prince lurking in the shadows... watching...her. </p><p> Antonietta laughed again at her own fanciful nonsense. She presented a certain image to the world: a confident, renowned concert pianist and respected composer. She dreamed her passionate dreams and turned each of them into soaring notes of music to express the fires burning deep inside where no one could see. </p><p> Her fingers raced across the keys, fluttered and coaxed, so that the music took on life. There was no warning whatsoever. One moment she was lost in her music, and the next, a rough hand clapped over her mouth and dragged her backward off the piano bench. </p><p> Antonietta bit down hard, reaching back to pound at the face of her assailant. It was then she really noticed how leaden her body felt, sluggish, almost unwilling to follow her orders. Rather than striking hard, she barely tapped the man. She had the impression of strength. He smelled of alcohol and mints. He thrust a cloth over her nose and mouth. </p><p> Antonietta coughed, thrashed in an effort to be rid of the foul-smelling material. She felt dizzy and lost the ability to move, sliding down, down toward semiconsciousness. At once she stopped fighting, slumping like a rag doll, pretending she was already unconscious. The cloth disappeared, and her assailant lifted her. </p><p> She was aware of being carried, of someone breathing hard. Of her heart pounding. Then they were outside in the biting cold and piercing wind. The sea raged and thundered loudly, and sea spray reached her face. </p><p> It took a few moments to realize that they were not alone. She heard a man's voice, slurred, incoherent, asking something. A chill went down her spine. Her grandfather, frail at eighty-two, was being dragged up the path to the cliffs right along with her. Determined not to allow anything to happen to him, Antonietta fought her way back, breathing deeply to draw oxygen into her laboring lungs, gathering her strength, biding her time. In her mind she began to chant his name, using it as a prayer, a litany of strength: <i>Byron. Byron. I need you now. Hurry, hurry. Byron. Where are you?</i> </p><p> * </p><p> Byron Justicano circled above the small city before winging his way toward the palazzo. As he moved across the sky, hunger crawled through his body, demanding he feed, but he ignored it, answering the sudden uneasy feeling churning in his gut. Something was wrong. Some intangible vibration in the air made him aware of the drama unfolding on the rocks below. A snarl exposed his fangs. Eyes glowed a frightening red in the dark of the night. A savage, bestial growl escaped his throat as he increased his speed, hurtling through the sky over the towering palazzo with its many stories and turrets and battlements. </p><p> Above the many terraces and lofty stories loomed a high, rounded tower where it was rumored more than one woman had been murdered in the murky past, earning the palace the dubious name of Palazzo della Morte. Winged gargoyles stared blankly at him out of the heavy, white fog, looking almost real as the creatures seemed to swarm up the side of the villa. Sitting on the craggy cliffs above the raging sea, the sprawling castle was dark and foreboding with the blank eyes of the statuary always watching. </p><p> The heavy forests that had once grown wild, a refuge to a multitude of animals, were long gone, replaced by groves and grapes. Byron preferred the freedom of the forests and mountains of his homeland, where he could run with the wolves if he desired, but the need to protect the occupant at the palazzo had become all consuming. </p><p> Alarm spread, a premonition of danger he couldn't shake. Byron increased his speed, streaking through the sky, flying low over the sprawling estate. The palazzo rose up out of the fog, architecture belonging to an era long gone, made of stone and stained glass, almost alive in the swirling mists. Byron ignored the ancient statues and the gleaming windows piercing the fog like so many eyes. </p><p> He first heard the voice whisper in his mind. Byron. Byron. I need you now. Hurry. Hurry. Byron. Where are you? She had never used a telepathic connection to him before. He had never taken her blood, yet he heard the words clearly and knew her need must be great to reach out to him. </p><p> Wicked forks of lightning whipped from cloud to cloud, anger he couldn't contain. She was in danger! Someone dared to threaten her. The sky roared, thunder splitting open the heavens to reveal a fury of flame. He took a breath, fought to control the elemental fear for her. The ground was reacting, rolling and buckling in answer to his mounting anger. </p><p> Byron hurried out toward the cove and the jagged rocks with his pulse pounding to the beat of the sea. The wind shifted and brought the haunting echo of a scream. His heart nearly stopped beating in his chest. It was the sound of despair, of death itself. </p><p> He swooped even lower over the sea, uncaring that he might be seen and discovered for the predator he was. Waves leapt toward the heavens, foamed, and collapsed with an angry boom, greedy for a living sacrifice. </p><p> "Byron!" This time she called his name aloud, her only chance while the clouds spun dark threads and the fog thickened in an attempt to cut off all escape. "Help us." The wind whipped the cry out over the roiling waves, straight to him. </p><p> There was a plea in her voice, soft and musical and alive with awareness. She knew he was close, as she always seemed to know. Antonietta Scarletti. Heiress to the Scarletti fortune. Composer of the most beautiful music the world had known in a long time and owner of the priceless Scarletti palazzo. The Palazzo della Morte, palace of death. Byron feared the curse of the palazzo would bring death to Antonietta, and he was determined to stop it. </p><p> Her voice brought alive the colors of the night, sharp and vivid and focused, where for so long there had been nothing but bleak gray. His heart stuttered, stammered, as it always did at the unexpected gift. It was that way each time he heard her voice, when she spoke his name in velvet tones. When she lit his world with colors and vivid details he had long ago lost. </p><p> Byron flew so low the churning waves splattered him with water as he raced over the choppy surface straight toward the sound of her voice. Through the swirling mists Byron saw Don Giovanni Scarletti in the greedy sea, clawing desperately for a purchase on the slick boulders. The waves slammed the old man hard, tossed him as if he were a small string of kelp, nothing more. The foaming water closed over the gray head and took him under. </p><p> "Byron!" The call came again. Haunting. Unforgettable. He knew he would hear that voice echo forever in his dreams. </p><p> She was up...</p></p><h2>Build Your Own Christmas Movie Romance: Pick Your Plot, Meet Your Man, and Create the Holiday Love Story of a Lifetime (Gifts for Movie &amp; TV Lovers)</h2><p><b>Create the Christmas Romance of Your Dreams Scene by Scene, Twist by Charmingly Predictable Twist</b><br><br>Slip on your favorite Christmas sweater, cozy up to a crackling fire, sip some spiced eggnog, and prepare to experience the ultimate holiday love story.

As amazing as it sounds, it is. There is significance in every event of our lives, from the most joyful and empowering to the inexplicable or seemingly unjust. In <i>Everything Happens for a Reason</i>, psychotherapist Mira Kirshenbaum encourages us to discover the meaning in what has happened to us, seeing these experiences as gifts, lessons, or opportunities. Building on more than twenty-five years of clinical research, Kirshenbaum helps us decode the confusing or unfortunate moments in our lives and find solace and strength.</p><p>Mira Kirshenbaum is a psychotherapist and researcher and the clinical director of the Chestnut Hill Institute in Boston, where she has practiced for twenty-five years. She is the author of six previous books, including the influential <i>Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay</i> and<i> Parent/Teen Breakthrough</i>.Is it really true that everything happens for a reason? After all, that's an amazing thing to say&#x2014;that no matter what happens to you, not only does something valuable come out of it but it's just what you need. <br><br>Amazing as it sounds, it is true. It's taken me a long time, but I now see that even in the worst disaster&#x2014;and I've had my share&#x2014;there are wonderful gifts, hidden opportunities, or life-enhancing lessons. And we couldn't have gotten them any other way. If someone as hardheaded as I am can come to understand this, anyone can. <br><br>Of course, sometimes it's easy for us to believe that everything happens for a reason. We see it in little ways, like when our plans for an evening out fall through at the last minute, and we discover that everything we really want is at home that night anyway. <br><br>And sometimes we see it in not-so-little ways. A woman I know wrenched her back and had to spend a month in bed. She felt this was the last thing she needed in her life, particularly since it happened at a time when she had to make some important decisions. And then it hit her&#x2014;this was exactly what she needed. Her old habit had been to rush impetuously into a new decision without thinking it through. Now it was as if life were saying, "If you won't give yourself time to think, I will." <br><br>We very much want to believe that the things that happen to us have great meaning. It's the way we feel life should be. Yes, some days we feel our life's a soap opera. But we want&#x2014;we need&#x2014;to have the sense that there's a purpose and value to it all. And we're right. <br><br>I want to reassure you: When you discover the true meaning of the events in your life, everything changes.<br><br>You feel stronger because your sense that everything has meaning gives you great confidence. <br><br>You feel wiser because you see how everything connects. <br><br>You're more in touch with who you are because you know that you're living the life you were meant to lead. <br><br>And you're happier because you're able to put your loss behind you and have a sense of a future filled with good things. <br><br>Until you get to this place, nothing is going to feel right. Let's say you're outdoors and you suddenly feel a drop of moisture fall on your head. You're not going to be able to think of anything else until you figure out why that happened. Is water dripping from some air conditioner up high? Is it starting to rain? Is a flying monkey peeing on your head? You have to know why that drop of moisture fell on your head because you can't feel safe going forward until you do. <br><br>We need to know why much more when what fell on our heads is a catastrophe. If you can't make sense of the catastrophe, it's as if your life is mere dice on a crap table&#x2014;if nothing has any meaning, everything's random, anything can happen. <br><br>It's painful to live not knowing why you got so sick that time or why you lost the love of your life&#x2014;much more painful than people suspect. One woman I know was flying home for Thanksgiving when she was in college. As the plane was flying along twenty thousand feet in the air, she developed a terrible earache. But that's not what made her cry. In the dark of a nighttime flight she was sobbing because there was pain like this in the world, seemingly without any rhyme or reason. <br><br>One guy described this feeling differently: "When I think about the bad stuff that's happened in my life, I feel I'm just a goddamn fool of the cosmos. It's humiliating! On a sidewalk crowded with people, I'm the one who's stepped in the dog poop. No one else is as stupid or unlucky as I am. The problem is: How can I go forward, how can I trust the future if I feel I am this stupid unlucky guy?" <br><br>Knowing that there's a reason for what happens also saves us from being filled with blame. Blame is a very human attempt to make sense of some catastrophe, but most of the time we hate the way it feels. And yet when something bad happens to us, it's almost a reflex to think, It's because everyone hates me, because I'm a loser, because I'm doomed. And so the blame begins. <br><br>We blame other people, and then we end up with the sense that the world is full of bad people. We blame ourselves, and then instead of feeling healthy, strong, and whole we see ourselves as sick, weak, and broken. And we blame life itself. What could be more demoralizing than feeling condemned to having bad things always happen to us and not being able to do anything about it?<br><br>Blame is like a boomerang that loops around and bonks us on the noggin. Try this yourself: If you see someone struggling with sadness, anxiety, and negativity, listen to his story. You'll soon see he's living in a world where all he sees are things to blame because he lives without positive meanings for what's happened to him. The only cure is to restore the sense that there is a good reason for everything that happens. <br><br>Explain That, Why Don't You?<br><br>Years ago, if you'd said to me, "Everything happens for a reason," I'd have said that was a lot of bull. Things happened in my life that were so painful it's no wonder I'd had trouble finding their meaning, and I gave up looking. I now know that was a big mistake. <br><br>Lots of things happen to us that challenge our sense that everything happens for a reason. It can be anything. You get seriously ill at the worst possible moment. You think you've found the love of your life but something goes haywire between you and now the two of you are over. You've had one of those really painful childhoods. You screw up and lose a lot of money. Someone you love dies. <br><br>Yeah, we think, maybe there's a meaning for some things that happen, but not for this. <br><br>And even if we still have a shred of faith left that there is meaning in these events, we don't know how to find it. After all, the events in our lives don't come to us with labels attached telling us what they mean. We can spend years searching in vain. We ask friends, but they haven't gone through what we have. We ask someone who has gone through something similar, but that person is probably struggling to find meaning, too. <br><br>At some point we might be tempted to give up the search. That's what happened to me. It took one of my patients to wake me up and give me the hope that we can discover the meaning of the events in our lives. Everything important I've learned about how to do my job I've learned from my patients. Scott* was one of my best "teachers."<br><br>The Message in the Bottle<br><br>We all have dreams of what we'd like to do with our lives. When Scott first came to see me many years ago he was dreaming about going back to school and becoming a landscape designer. But he was afraid to give up his well-paying job. As you can imagine, addressing underlying issues of anxiety, low self-esteem, and identity played an important role in our work together. Soon, though, our work was all about helping him get what he needed to make his dream come true. He ultimately completed a two-year program at an excellent school and eventually opened his own little landscape-design business. He felt fulfilled.<br><br>Several years later Scott came back to work with me. Sadly, he had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and he thought he was dying. (Scott's cancer eventually went into remission. He's still okay.) He said he wanted to discover why this terrible disease had happened to him just when his life was starting to work out. "Isn't this really a theological question?" I asked Scott. Truthfully, I didn't want to deal with a question like this. My attitude at that time was that you could never find an answer. And anyway, the most important thing is to make the best use of the time you have remaining. Why ask why?<br><br>But Scott, bless him, held onto his need. He was about to teach me an important lesson about how helping people is ultimately about helping them find meaning. After I'd dismissed his question Scott looked at me with tears in his eyes as if I'd betrayed him and said, "You don't understand. I don't want to die feeling like I was just some squirrel that got run over on the highway of life&#x2014;hey, man, bad luck. I know that I'm not just a victim of a game of chance. I can't believe that I live in a universe where the things that happen to us don't have any meaning. There is some meaning in this, a message in a bottle for me. The message feels just out of reach, but it's very important to me. Help me get that message."<br><br>Somehow that got through to me. I remembered how much I, too, had wanted to get that message back when I was a kid. (In a few moments I'll tell you about all the things that had happened to me and my family that left me hungry to find some kind of meaning and how discouraged I got when I didn't think I could find any.) Looking in Scott's eyes, I lost my sense of being pissed off at the universe because the things that happen to us don't come neatly labeled with their true meanings. Scott's need reawakened my own and all the hopes that came with it. I'd thought my need for meaning was dead. I'd acted as if it were dead. But the utter genuineness and validity of Scott's need made me realize that my own need for meaning had never died. Suddenly I felt a whole new connection to Scott, to my younger self, and to a world of people who were hungry to feel that what happens to them has meaning. <br><br>There was just one problem: How in the world could I help Scott discover why he'd gotten sick and might die if I couldn't help myself? I found myself terribly moved as I told him that I saw how this situation should have meaning and then confessed that I didn't know how to help him find that meaning. I felt I'd failed him. And I felt terrible about it. But I made a promise to myself that I would learn how to help people find the true meanings of the events in their lives. <br><br>Scott called several months later. He obviously wasn't as disappointed in me as I was in myself. I guess we all know how tough this search is. He had a note of triumph in his voice. <br><br>"I know why I got sick!" he said. "Look at where I was in my life. I'd made a lot of progress, but I was still frightened of so many things&#x2014;flying, confrontations, bad news, you name it. Here's the gift getting sick gave me. Every day I'm learning not to be afraid, big-time. Death is the big confrontation. Once you face death, how can you be afraid of, like, someone rejecting you? You know, it's true: Cowards die a thousand deaths, heroes die but once. I'd rather live a short life without fear than the living death of a long life filled with fear.<br><br>"And I wouldn't have discovered any of this if I hadn't gotten sick. I don't know how much time I have left to live, but in the time I have left I'm feeling more alive and less afraid than I ever did before."<br><br>Everyone who survives something feels they have a new lease on life. But Scott felt he had a new lease on life even when he thought he was dying. Understanding that there was meaning in what was happening to him, discovering what that meaning was, made all the difference for him. <br><br>It made all the difference for me, too.<br>A Voyage of Discovery<br><br>That was the beginning of my own voyage of discovery. Wow, I thought, it really changes everything if you can discover the reason why some life event has overtaken you. But I was still skeptical&#x2014;I was far from convinced that Scott had discovered the real reason why he'd gotten sick or if a real reason could be discovered. But it had meaning for him, and as a therapist, I had to take this seriously. Just imagine, I thought, if I could help other people discover what Scott was lucky enough to discover. . . . <br><br>Deep down, of course, I knew how badly I needed this myself. <br><br>My Story<br><br>I'm sure I've had more than my share of blessings. I've been happily married for a long time. I have two great kids. I have good friends. Over the years it's been my privilege to help hundreds of thousands of people, and I love my work. So maybe you're wondering, "Hey, what does Mira know about what it's like to go through something really bad?" Good question. <br><br>I grew up with loss baked in my bones. As a child of Holocaust survivors, I lost the entire world in which I was supposed to grow up. Yeah, my parents survived. But everyone else in my family was killed: my mother's seven brothers and sisters, my father's five, all four of my grandparents. <br><br>I also lost the early years of my childhood. I was smuggled across Europe at the bottom of a hay wagon. I almost died of dysentery when I was three months old. I lived in a refugee camp for the first four years of my life. A barracks full of grown-ups recovering from shattered lives doesn't make for a good-time nursery school.<br><br>When I was four my life again turned upside down and inside out. I lost my father and my sister&#x2014;my parents had gotten divorced and my father and my sister disappeared from my life. Then I left the only world I'd known, the refugee camp, to come to America. <br><br>When I arrived in New York I was so skinny that one of my distant relatives burst into tears when he saw me. My mother went to work in a clothing factory, and I had to take care of my brother. She eventually remarried, but my stepfather was no bargain. And we were poor&#x2014;I didn't get a new dress until I was ten, and I bought it for myself with the money I'd earned baby-sitting.</p><h2>HBR Guide to Getting the Right Work Done (HBR Guide Series)</h2><p><p><b>IS YOUR WORKLOAD SLOWING YOU&#x2015;AND YOUR CAREER&#x2015;DOWN?</b></p><p>Your inbox is overflowing.

Clarke, Andy Warhol, William S. Burroughs, Janis Joplin, Eugene O'Neill, Rufus Wainwright, Betsey Johnson, R. Crumb, Thomas Wolfe, Jasper Johns&#x2014;these are just a few of the figures who at one time occupied one of the most alluring and storied residences ever: the Chelsea Hotel. Born during the Gilded Age and once the tallest building in New York, the twelve-story landmark has long been a magnet for artists, writers, musicians, and cultural provocateurs of all stripes.<br><br>In this book, photographer Colin Miller and writer Ray Mock intimately portray the enduring bohemian spirit of the Chelsea Hotel through interviews with nearly two dozen current residents and richly detailed photographs of their unique spaces. As documented in Miller's abundant photographs, these apartments project the quirky decorating sensibilities of urban aesthetes who largely work in film, theater, and the visual arts, resulting in deliriously ornamental spaces with a kitschy edge. Weathering the overall homogenization of New York and the rapid transformation of the hotel itself&#x2014;amid recent ownership changeovers and tenant lawsuits&#x2014;residents remain in about seventy apartments while the rest of the units are converted to rentals (and revert to a hotel-stay basis, which had ceased in 2011). <br><br>For the community of artists and intellectuals who remain, the uncertain status of the hotel is just another stage in a roller-coaster history. A fascinating portrait of a strand of resilient bohemian New Yorkers and their creative, deeply idiosyncratic homes, <i>Hotel Chelsea&nbsp;</i>is a rich visual and narrative document of a cultural destination as complicated as it is mythical.</p><p><b>Colin Miller </b>is a photographer based in Brooklyn, New York.

I was just gonna say no cause I can hardly find time to write an email these days or how about a dream? Or that thing Rosy said about being brave and what it felt like when Lewis clapped with glee after Chris beatboxed for Rosy&#x2019;s dark disco tooth brushing session last night and if I&#x2019;m gonna write anything do I wanna write the foreword to someone else&#x2019;s book about how bohemian the bohemians are and how cool it is that I was raised by an artist bohemian enough to live in the mecca of bohemianism and what a loss and oh the city and all those hideous chase banks and what about that old bum on the stoop I would chat with every day while eating my soggy �clair from the corner donut shop that is now a Starbucks before I would go home to rollerblade down the halls and drop eggs off the balcony and&#x2014;oh yeah they love it&#x2014;step over that syringe in the back stairway while running upstairs to eat chicken and broccoli with Ruth and family cause mom &#x201c;just can&#x2019;t take it anymore&#x201d;&#x2014;you know living on the postage stamp. And ahh those were the days and the f***ing rich blah blah blah and if I&#x2019;m gonna finally write about it all I will do it for my own book, film, or play, or eulogy, and then I thought you should do it cause you&#x2019;ve already written so much and it&#x2019;s so good and then I thought I could interview you and then I thought we could just write emails like this one in the 5 minutes before the baby wakes. And then I would convince them that they&#x2019;re bohemian enough to let this be the foreword. What do you think? Ah there&#x2019;s that baby! xo<br> ALEX: You and I are forever bonded by our dead sibling, the Chelsea Hotel. We two are the rare few who really and truly grew up in the Chelsea Hotel and it takes a lot of intentional looking the other way when I hear about Chelsea stories from rich people who moved there in the 2000s because they CHOSE to live a &#x201c;bohemian&#x201d; lifestyle. As an adult, I had to give yoga classes to some of these characters IN the Chelsea Hotel, which I could no longer afford to live in even if I had wanted to, and finally I was forced out of NY altogether. That&#x2019;s the hard thing to explain. We didn&#x2019;t choose the Chelsea Hotel. We ended up there because Stanley didn&#x2019;t ask for a deposit or a lease. Mom always wanted to move out of our &#x201c;postage stamp&#x201d; of an apartment, but she just couldn&#x2019;t get it together for all of the reasons that drew her to the Chelsea in the first place. Yeah, we don&#x2019;t want to sound like bitter expats . . . and yet . . . we do have this love story to share. I loved the Chelsea so much. I loved waiting for you to come home to our little apartment the night you were born. Now that I&#x2019;m 48 and raising my kids in this neoliberal, helicopter-parenting world, I so often dig back into the memory banks to relive the freedom and community and uncanny surprises that waited for us in that lobby. I go through a somatic journey: through the lobby-I-know like-the-back-of-my-hand, sneak into the sinister El Quijote bathrooms to tend to my recurring bloody nose, up to the first floor elevators if I don&#x2019;t feel like talking to Merle, and while I wait for the gold elevator I spit into the first-floor stairwell to see how it differed from spitting from the 7th floor. . . . Okay I gotta go . . . love you.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> PHOTOGRAPHER&#x2019;S NOTE [excerpt]<br>The photographs in this book capture a moment in this process and frame an instant of a city in constant transition. It would be false to claim that the Chelsea&#x2019;s history has been peaceful. But although gentrification and renovation have strained tenants&#x2019; quality of life, these burdens have replaced an existence in which the front desk was protected by bulletproof glass and drug use proliferated within the hotel&#x2019;s walls. Despite the uniqueness of the hotel, its tenants tell a familiar narrative of life in a rapidly evolving city and increasingly exclusive real estate market. This book is about how a group of eccentric and varied personalities coexist and preserve the oral history of a rich and important part of New York City. The tenants have found a way to create and sustain a refuge where life and creativity have flourished. Gone are the times when those living alternative lifestyles could find shelter here for meager rents. The spaces that can accommodate artists who have yet to achieve broad success have long since moved far from the Chelsea. But those artists who found that here have persisted; they&#x2019;re still living creative and important lives. On one of my last shoots for this book I met a great artist and tenant at the Chelsea, Bettina Grossman. Though she decided not to be part of the project, I noticed on her door as I was leaving, a small scrap of paper with the handwritten words &#x201c;Sanctuary&#x2014;Protect the Magic.&#x201d; I hope my work will help to preserve and share some of the magic of the Hotel Chelsea.<br>&#x2014;COLIN MILLER</p><h2>Confidence (HBR Emotional Intelligence Series)</h2><p><p><b>You need confidence</b> to inspire trust, communicate effectively, and succeed in your organization.

Yet few companies approach pricing in a way that fully capitalizes on its value. This <i>Second Edition</i>, a major revision and extension of the first book, shows you what it takes to achieve <i>the price advantage</i> in today's competitive and complex business environments. Based on in-depth, first-hand experience with thousands of companies, this book provides managers with a pragmatic guide through the maze of pricing issues. It reinforces why pricing excellence is more critical than ever today and then explains state-of-the-art approaches to analyzing and improving your own pricing strategy and execution.</p> <ul> <li>Explores the fundamental role of pricing infrastructure in achieving <i>the price advantage</i></li> <li>Includes new topics such as software and information products pricing, lifecycle pricing, custom-configured products pricing, pricing of high-count product lines, pricing in distributed sales environments, "razor/razor blades" pricing, and tiered products and services pricing</li> <li>Revisits the full range of classic McKinsey pricing tools, including the pocket price waterfall and value maps</li> </ul> <p>Engaging and informative, the <i>Second Edition</i> of <i>The Price Advantage</i> will put this essential discipline in perspective.</p></p><p><p>For all the advantages businesses pursue, there is one powerful advantage that is accessible to virtually every business--but realized by very few. That advantage is the price advantage. Pricing is far and away the most sensitive profit lever that managers can influence. Very small changes in average price translate into huge changes in operating profit, yet few companies are as disciplined and deliberate about pricing as they should be.</p> <p>In the most comprehensive and insightful treatment of pricing management available today, this Second Edition of The Price Advantage shows companies how to use pricing excellence to outperform competitors and increase profitability in both good and bad times. Drawing on more than three decades of client success, three preeminent McKinsey &amp; Company experts demonstrate why pricing is critical to bottom-line profitability and explain state-of-the-art approaches to analyzing pricing and building distinctive pricing capability. Working with colleagues and companies across the globe, they have helped develop leading-edge practical knowledge in pricing for clients in all major industries.</p> <p>Written in pragmatic terms, this Second Edition of The Price Advantage continues to be the practical pricing guide for thoughtful general managers who have been tempted by the unrealized promise of improved pricing and, perhaps, even frustrated by attempts to translate pricing theory into bottom-line impact. It provides a structured approach for identifying where the most precious sources of untapped pricing opportunity reside in a business, along with practical, case-illustrated guidance on how to capture that opportunity.</p> <p>Updated throughout to reflect changes in the global pricing environment and advances in McKinsey's pricing knowledge, this Second Edition covers a host of new topics including software and information products pricing, lifecycle pricing, custom-configured products pricing, pricing of high-count product lines, pricing in distributed sales environments, and tiered products and services pricing. Also, the building of a sustainable pricing capability and a high-performing pricing infrastructure is covered in much greater detail than ever before.</p> <p>With emphasis on translating pricing theory into real improvements and bottom-line performance, the Second Edition of The Price Advantage is designed to give today's CEOs and business managers a competitive advantage in any economy.</p><b>Praise for THE PRICE ADVANTAGE, SECOND EDITION</b> <p>"This book is a treasure&#x2015;a practical yet intellectually sound guide to pricing that is applicable to both large and small companies. Frankly, in all my years writing about economics and covering corporate decision making, I have not seen pricing strategy and tactics explained so clearly as in this book."<br> &#x2015;<b>Michael Mandel</b>, former chief economist, <i>BusinessWeek</i>, and Editor-in-Chief, <i>Visible Economy LLC</i></p> <p>"This book is both insightful and practical. Many companies overlook the substantial profit opportunities from smart pricing. The authors show you not only where to look for, but also how to capture and sustain those opportunities."<br> &#x2015;<b>James M. Kilts</b>, former chairman and CEO, The Gillette Company</p> <p>"The Price Advantage is very straightforward and direct, with concise and easily applied coverage of each and every topic."<br> &#x2015;<b>David J. Reibstein</b>, Marketing Professor, The Wharton School</p> <p>The <i>Second Edition of The Price Advantage</i>, written by three preeminent experts at McKinsey &amp; Company, is the most pragmatic and insightful book on pricing available.</p> <p>Based on in-depth, firsthand experience with hundreds of companies, as well as significant investments in new pricing research, this book is designed to be a comprehensive guide for managers through the maze of pricing issues.</p> <p>The authors examine state-of-the-art approaches for analyzing and improving pricing performance, demonstrate those approaches with real case studies, and draw a pricing excellence blueprint for companies to follow. In good economic times or bad, achieving the price advantage is critical to corporate performance and profitability.</p></p><h2>A Concise History of Italy (Cambridge Concise Histories)</h2><p>Since its formation in 1861, Italy has struggled to develop an effective political system and a secure sense of national identity. This new edition of Christopher Duggan&#39;s acclaimed introduction charts the country&#39;s history from the fall of the Roman Empire in the west to the present day and surveys the difficulties Italy has faced during the last two centuries in forging a nation state.

Long considered a classic in the field, WRITING IN GENERAL is the product of a lifetime of reflection by one of our best literary minds.</p><p>"There are now not enough commercial magazines regularly publishing literary fiction to count on the fingers of a single hand," says Rust Hills. So why bother writing literary short stories, or books about doing so? Because, says Hills, a longtime fiction editor at <i>Esquire</i>, "what young writers want to write, or ought to want to write, is literature." In <i>Writing in General and the Short Story in Particular</i>, Hills examines "the essential techniques of fiction and how they function." The short story is a tricky form, with no margin for error: "The successful contemporary short story," says Hills, "will demonstrate a more harmonious relationship of all its aspects than will any other literary art form, excepting perhaps lyric poetry." Many of the fictional elements discussed in this book will not be new to most fiction writers. We know that stories must have beginnings, middles, and ends; we know about epiphany and suspense and stock characters. But Hills claims that much of how we look at fiction derives from drama theory and from the formulas of "slick fiction" (fiction that once served the purpose mindless television now serves). Learned but not pedantic, Hills addresses these elements strictly in terms of literary short fiction. <p> An interesting side note here is Hills's discussion of the shift in support for American writers. "It is no longer the book publishers and magazines," he says, "but rather the colleges and universities that ... provide the major financial support for the great majority of American writers today." Given that, we might find it odd that this book comes from a man best known for his magazine editing. But we shouldn't. "Teaching fiction writing and editing magazine fiction have ... the same rather odd ultimate purpose in common: trying to get someone else to produce a fine short story." One caveat emptor: our copy of this edition fell quite apart upon our first, gentle reading of it. <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>Lawrence Rust Hills (9 November 1924 &#x2013; 12 August 2008) was an American author and fiction editor at <i>Esquire</i> from 1957 to 1964, though he remained associated with the magazine until 1999.<br><p></p> <p><br>Authors he championed include Norman Mailer, John Cheever, William Styron, Bruce Jay Friedman, William Gaddis, James Salter, Don DeLillo, Ann Beattie, Richard Ford, Raymond Carver and E.

After enlisting in the Marines at seventeen, then being wounded in Santo Domingo during the Dominican crisis, Kugler arrived in Vietnam in early 1966.<br><br>As a new sniper with the 4th Marines, Kugler picked up bush skills while attached to 3d Force Recon Company, and then joined the grunts. To take advantage of that experience, he formed the Rogues, a five-sniper team that hunted in the Co Bi-Than Tan Valley for VC and NVA. His descriptions of long, tense waits, sudden deadly action, and NVA countersniper ambushes are fascinating.<br><br>In DEAD CENTER, Kugler demonstrates the importance to a sniper of patience, marksmanship, bush skills, and guts--while underscoring exactly what a country demands of its youth when it sends them to war.</p><p>A former Marine scout-sniper, Ed Kugler served two tours in Vietnam as a sniper and sergeant with the 4th Marines in I Corps. He is the recipient of two Purple Hearts and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. He is the author of the inspirational self-help booklet A Dozen Things I Learned About Life as a Marine Sniper in Vietnam. Following his four-year hitch in the Marine Corps, Ed distinguished himself in the corporate world. He spent ten years in his family&#39;s trucking business before working sixteen years in management with PepsiCo&#39;s Frito-Lay and Pepsi-Cola divisions. He was then Vice President, Worldwide Logistics, for Compaq Computer Corporation and vice president of Telxon Corporation. Today Ed is a business and change management consultant. He lives with his wife of thirty years and their family in Spring, Texas.CHAPTER ONE<br> &nbsp;<br> Snipers Up&nbsp;...&nbsp;Hell Yes!<br> &nbsp;<br> It might be January, but it&#x2019;s hotter than hell. The sun&#x2019;s streaming through the trees, creating shadows that streak across the sergeant&#x2019;s face. He&#x2019;s working himself into a thick lather as he describes what Nam&#x2019;s like. It&#x2019;s for the education of trainees like me in the audience. &#x201c;At night, it&#x2019;s blacker than the inside of an ape&#x2019;s ass at midnight!&#x201d; he bellows. He&#x2019;s dark with a Nam tan; his looks betray his irrational nature. He works to impress the fifty or so of us, the fresh meat, seated on makeshift wooden benches. It&#x2019;s jungle training, it&#x2019;s Camp Pendleton, and it&#x2019;s weird.<br> &nbsp;<br> My mind drifts away from his antics to my arrival in California just two days earlier. I&#x2019;m back sitting in a little park just outside the bus station in Oceanside. I&#x2019;m fresh in from the frigid January winds of Cleveland. And I love the warm, short-sleeve weather of Southern California. I sit, listening to someone&#x2019;s radio playing &#x201c;Monday Monday.&#x201d; Me, the Mamas and the Papas, and all this wonderful weather, how can it be? I&#x2019;m sitting in Oceanside, waiting for my bus to Pendleton, and I think, Man, this&#x2019;ll be a good place to come when all the Marine and Nam stuff is over. This is nice, it&#x2019;s damned nice!<br> &nbsp;<br> Well that was a couple days ago, and this is now. I&#x2019;m listening to a sergeant rant and rave about our fate, how half of us are coming home flat-ass on a stretcher or dead, dumb, and cold in a body bag. He&#x2019;s screaming at anyone who falls asleep. He blasts one Marine with, &#x201c;You asshole, you&#x2019;re gonna get people killed.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t know if it was the heat, the Mamas and the Papas, or &#x201c;California Dreamin&#x2019;,&#x201d; but none of what he was saying registered with me. I just wanted to get through the shit and get it on. We were in &#x201c;jungle training,&#x201d; California style. I guess it was all the Corps had on short notice; the Nam buildup caught everyone off guard. We were in jungle training, but there wasn&#x2019;t a jungle within a thousand miles of Camp Pendleton.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our training would last four weeks. Then, we&#x2019;d each be individual replacements for Marine units already calling Vietnam home. For the grunt trainee, peacetime life in the Corps sucked. It was major boring. And jungle training for Nam was no exception. We&#x2019;d split our days getting Nam ready, physically and mentally. Then we&#x2019;d learn the skills necessary to stay alive and kill gooks when we got there.<br> &nbsp;<br> Getting in shape was a major ball buster. We&#x2019;d be out back of the camp some damn place, humping the barren hills in full battle gear all day long. Between the heat of the California sun and the weight we were humping, our thighs were always burning. The climb up those bastardly hills was a major ass kicker. &#x201c;You assholes get in shape,&#x201d; the sergeant would scream, &#x201c;or you&#x2019;ll get your ass left behind in Nam!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The very thought of being left behind in Nam kept most of us going. Who the hell wanted to be left behind in Nam or anywhere for that matter? What the hell is Nam anyway? I didn&#x2019;t know, but hell, I wanted to go anyway. I wanted to serve my country. That&#x2019;s what the Corps was all about. That&#x2019;s why I joined. We all felt that way.<br> &nbsp;<br> Training with all the guys I didn&#x2019;t know was boot camp all over. It didn&#x2019;t have the restrictions, but it was a foreign affair for me. I only knew a couple of the guys out of the hundreds going through training. I was never one to just join in with groups I didn&#x2019;t know; I usually had only one or two close friends at a time. Jungle school was no exception. I occasionally saw a couple of guys who were in Santo Domingo with me, but it was rare. It was all like starting over. I felt the Corps could do better with units that were formed and trained intact. But it wasn&#x2019;t to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before long I struck up with a kid just out of boot camp. He was from Houston. I knew him only as Thompson, his last name and the universal military tag.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thompson was a really nice kid. Like me, he&#x2019;d joined the Corps at seventeen, but he went to boot camp in San Diego, then got his orders for Nam. He wasn&#x2019;t as excited about the prospect as I was. He was seventeen years old, and I was eighteen, and I had Santo Domingo under my belt, and that made me an old salt to him. Thompson even looked young. Too damn young to be married! I couldn&#x2019;t believe that when he told me. Told me he married a Mexican girl he went with in high school. Did it as soon as he found out he was going to Nam. What the hell was he thinking?<br> &nbsp;<br> I didn&#x2019;t need to agree with him to like him; we hit it off from day one and stayed together all through training, beside each other every step of the way. Up and down, up and down as we humped endlessly through the hills around Pendleton. Marching every morning to get in shape. Each afternoon, we tried to keep each other awake in the face of our instructors&#x2019; endless droning. We&#x2019;d get their drift early on, but that didn&#x2019;t stop them; they made the &#x201c;gooks,&#x201d; as they called them, out to be purely invincible. They told us story after story about how the Viet Cong could sneak up to a sentry in the middle of the night, slit his throat, then be gone before his buddies even knew he was dead.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even with all of us knee-deep in boredom, some stories began a wave of emotion that would wash over the half-attentive audience, drawing responses from the disbelief of &#x201c;Give me a fucking break,&#x201d; to the fear of &#x201c;Oh my God, how will I survive?&#x201d; Thompson worried a lot. He just wanted to go to Nam, do his duty, and get back in one piece. He talked endlessly of the life he wanted to build with his little lady. He didn&#x2019;t want some gook sneaking up and ending his dreams. I had no dreams like his but I still didn&#x2019;t believe some little bastard could sneak up and slit my throat without my knowing about it either. They were human weren&#x2019;t they?<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;d have to wait &#x2019;til Nam to know for sure. Training continued to be a drag, but the mock-up of the booby-trapped village got my attention. It was the next to last stop in training at jungle school, and the instructors were enthusiastic Nam vets. After my first walk, I was paranoid for sure. And if I was paranoid, then Thompson was a basket case. He hadn&#x2019;t looked forward to Vietnam before, and after all the stories of gore from the booby traps, he was down for the count.<br> &nbsp;<br> They said the booby-trap village was a replica of what we&#x2019;d find in Vietnam. It had grass huts and trails and everything else needed to simulate what we would run into as Nam grunts. I wanted to go to Nam, but I didn&#x2019;t want that cannon fodder bullshit that I&#x2019;d seen in Santo Domingo. Grunts are beautiful, but they&#x2019;re usually the first dead. The booby traps focused my attention better than all the lectures we&#x2019;d endured. I could look at a punji pit with its razor-sharp stakes and see firsthand what a bummer that&#x2019;d be. The idea of the stakes alone was bad enough without having to worry about some gook rubbing his shit on them to infect my wounds.<br> &nbsp;<br> We&#x2019;d been training hard and we needed a break; we&#x2019;d had daily early morning runs, hikes that lasted all day, and hour after hour of afternoon lectures. By the time we had finished the hands-on booby-trap training, two weeks had passed, during which we&#x2019;d spend lots of evenings in the pool, taking swimming tests, so we were ready for a break. Lighten up, guys, we&#x2019;ll be ready for Nam&nbsp;...&nbsp;a break, okay, just a break?<br> &nbsp;<br> Finally word came that the next weekend was ours: a seventy-two-hour pass! I&#x2019;d run into an old buddy from Dom Rep and the 6th Marines. He suggested we go to Tijuana, Mexico. The old salts called it TJ. All I knew was that it was south of California somewhere. Thompson didn&#x2019;t want to make the trip, but I convinced him to come along and have some fun. &#x201c;What could it hurt?&#x201d; I said. My Dom Rep friend, Hanscomb, brought along a buddy of his, and the four of us were off to TJ.<br> &nbsp;<br> First thing Saturday morning, we boarded a bus from the base to Oceanside. There, we changed buses for the two-hour ride south to Tijuana. It was a gorgeous day. The more I saw of California, the more I loved what I saw. The ride was great, the time raced by, and we soon passed through San Diego and on to the border. We got off the bus on the U.S. side, right at the border.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hanscomb said he knew the way; he&#x2019;d been there on his last tour at Pendleton. He was elated, said he couldn&#x2019;t wait to see our faces when we saw Tijuana. His buddy played along with him; either he&#x2019;d been there before or didn&#x2019;t want to let us first timers know that he hadn&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don&#39;t Need</h2><p><em>The Overspent American</em> explores why so many of us feel materially dissatisfied, why we work staggeringly long hours and yet walk around with ever-present mental "wish lists" of things to buy or get, and why Americans save less than virtually anyone in the world. Unlike many experts, Harvard economist Juliet B. Schor does not blame consumers' lack of self-discipline. Nor does she blame advertisers. Instead she analyzes the crisis of the American consumer in a culture where spending has become the ultimate social art.</p><p>If getting and spending define our lives, then Juliet Schor now has us covered. Six years ago, her book <i>The Overworked American</i> scrutinized the getting part. It focused public attention on the disappearance of leisure and the harmful effects thereof on families and society. It sparked a debate over whether Americans really work as much as we proudly claim. (If so, how to explain the audience for <i>Monday Night Football</i>?) Nevertheless, Schor can take credit for helping push Congress into passing the Family Leave Act in 1993. <p> Now she is back with a critique of our spending. Schor notes that, despite rising wealth and incomes, Americans do not feel any better off. In fact, we tell pollsters we do not have enough money to buy everything we need. And we are almost as likely to say so if we make $85,000 a year as we are if we make $35,000. Schor believes that "keeping up with the Joneses" is no longer enough for today's media-savvy office workers. We set our sights on the lifestyles of those higher up the organizational chart. We seek to emulate characters on TV. For teenagers, "enough" is the idle splendor that hardly exists outside of what MTV un-ironically calls <i>The Real World</i>. Schor offers an original and provocative analysis of why many Americans feel driven and unhappy despite our success. As an alternative, she profiles several "downshifters" who've taken up voluntary simplicity in search of a more satisfying way of life. No policy solutions suggest themselves this time, only a change of heart. <i>--Barry Mitzman</i></p>Juliet B. Schor, bestselling author of <em>The Overworked American</em> and senior lecturer and Director of Studies, Women's Studies, at Harvard University, writes and lectures widely on issues of work and consumption.

That may be bad news for America, but it can be good news for the church. What's needed now, in shifting times, is neither a doubling-down on the status quo nor a pullback into isolation. Instead, we need a church that speaks to social and political issues with a bigger vision in mind: that of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As Christianity seems increasingly strange, and even subversive, to our culture, we have the opportunity to reclaim the freakishness of the gospel, which is what gives it its power in the first place.<br> &nbsp;<br> We seek the kingdom of God, before everything else. We connect that kingdom agenda to the culture around us, both by speaking it to the world and by showing it in our churches. As we do so, we remember our mission to oppose demons, not to demonize opponents. As we advocate for human dignity, for religious liberty, for family stability, let's do so as those with a prophetic word that turns everything upside down.<br> &nbsp;<br> The signs of the times tell us we are in for days our parents and grandparents never knew. But that's no call for panic or surrender or outrage. Jesus is alive. Let's act like it. Let's follow him, onward to the future.</p><p><b>Russell Moore</b> is president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest Protestant denomination.

I learned a lot about ghosts for this book. It was fascinating to hear about ghosts that people have encountered. Thanks to all of the lovely people who shared their ghost stories with me. It was equally interesting to learn how some people have manipulated situations to make us believe in ghosts. The Apparition Apprehenders took me into the believers&#x2019; side of the paranormal, and Eva&#x2019;s position led me to examine the scientific position. I have learned a great deal, mostly that there is no grand conclusion. </p><p>Special thanks to Shawny Darby for answering my questions about ghost hunting. And also to Kathleen Joyce, who suggested the name Apparition Apprehenders. As always, I couldn&#x2019;t do this without my editor, Sandra Harding, and my agent, Jessica Faust. I thank Susan and PJ Erba for taste-testing the recipes for me. And my dear friends Betsy Strickland and Amy Wheeler for always being so supportive. I can&#x2019;t forget my mother, my first reader and biggest fan.

Nonsense, folderol, fiddle-faddle.&#x201d;</p><p>No sooner had she spoken than the automatic sliding glass doors to the parking lot whooshed open. A gust of wind blew in, bringing dried leaves with it.</p><p>A grey Weimaraner with startling blue eyes stepped away from the doors and growled. Gingersnap, the Sugar Maple Inn&#x2019;s canine ambassador, simply wagged her tail. In typical golden retriever fashion, she continued kissing the guests gathered in the reception area.</p><p>The doors closed again as if a person had passed through. I felt the chill of a late October wind pass by.</p><p>&#x201c;I bet there&#x2019;s a ghost in here now,&#x201d; Casey Collins whispered, gazing up at the ceiling and shoving his glasses to the bridge of his nose with his index finger. Casey worked at the inn as a desk clerk but seemed more like a little brother than an employee. At twenty, he still looked boyish and reminded me of the young Harry Potter, with similar glasses, a shock of dark hair that always fell over his forehead, and sweet, innocent eyes.</p><p>Five guests who were part of the Apparition Apprehender ghost hunting team had arrived a few minutes ago and were waiting to check in. They had come to town to shoot what they hoped would be a pilot episode for a potential TV show about ghosts. Wagtail had plenty of them, but the most well-known allegedly haunted the creepy old Wagtail Springs Hotel. At the mention of a ghost, the guys dived into their luggage and pulled out assorted handheld machines. The chatter behind Eva stopped as they concentrated on their gizmos, apparently trying to prove the ghost&#x2019;s existence through technological devices.</p><p>I raised my voice a little to get their attention. &#x201c;Welcome to the Sugar Maple Inn. I&#x2019;m Holly Miller. If you need anything during your stay, please let me know.&#x201d; I smiled broadly, but they were intent on their machines. Oh well.</p><p>Eva turned her eyes toward the ceiling and shook her head in amused disbelief. The doors were automatic, but I had to admit that opening on their own had been odd. Probably the result of that gust of wind.</p><p>Only the day before, I had moved to Wagtail Mountain permanently to join my grandmother, Liesel Miller, as her partner in running the Sugar Maple Inn. Halloween was nearly upon us and the first thing I had seen at the outskirts of town was a huge orange banner over the road that proclaimed <i>Welcome to Howloween in Wagtail, where spooky things are afoot!</i> A cat with an arched back adorned one side and a howling dog decorated the other.</p><p>The inn&#x2019;s Halloween decorations only added to the fun. Pumpkins clustered at the base of the doors on both sides. Spiderwebs clung to the walls with a parade of faux spiders marching along them. The sinister figure of a grinning vampire hanging upside down in a black cape was enough to give anyone a chill. Two skulls lay at rakish angles on top of the registration counter, and vultures peered at us from the large antler chandelier overhead.</p><p>My grandmother, whom I called <i>Oma</i>, German for <i>grandma</i>, had flitted off to a meeting of some sort, leaving me to keep an eye on the Apparition Apprehenders when they checked in.</p><p>Not that I minded. I welcomed any excuse to leave my apartment on the top floor. Boxes upon boxes cluttered my quarters. My entire life was still packed, except, of course, for my calico kitten, Twinkletoes, and my Jack Russell terrier, Trixie, who sniffed around the back of the reception desk in search of the treat jar.</p><p>Zelda, another desk clerk, had called me when the ghost hunting crew arrived. I hadn&#x2019;t expected any major problems, but here I was, already thinking that I would have to have a little talk with Casey about arguing with guests. After all, Eva was paying to stay with us, and if she didn&#x2019;t believe in ghosts, that was her business.</p><p>&#x201c;That was <i>not</i> a ghost.&#x201d; Eva took a deep breath and watched the antics of the guys behind her. She turned back to Zelda and me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a university professor and have students like them. What frightens <i>me</i> is not ghosts, but the fact that my students and people like these ghost hunters believe ridiculous claims of spirit sightings. If these gentlemen would think it through, they would understand the absurdity of believing in ghosts.&#x201d;</p><p>Eva wore thick glasses in pink cat-eye frames that accentuated the odd paleness of her skin. Clearly vintage, a boxy coat of drab green wool hung on her, at least two sizes too large. A wide pink hairband pulled her dark hair back&#x2014;very 1960s. She was thirtyish, like me, I guessed.</p><p>A Siamese cat on a leash jumped onto the registration counter, startling Trixie. She yipped at the cat and danced around to the lobby side. When she saw the open bags, she lost interest in the cat and buried her nose in a duffel bag.</p><p>I glanced at Eva&#x2019;s reservation. She&#x2019;d been booked as part of the Apparition Apprehenders group. Obviously an error on our part. She should be in the cat wing. An easy fix.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. It appears we&#x2019;ve made a little mistake. I have you down as one of the ghost hunters. But no matter, we can&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your confusion is understandable. My reservation was made by Mr. Luciano, the producer who is in charge of the ghost hunting expedition. I&#x2019;m the ghost debunker whom he hired.&#x201d;</p><p>Ghost debunker? She definitely shouldn&#x2019;t be staying near the ghost hunters. Her cat would be happier in the Cat&#x2019;s Pajamas, our cats-only wing, anyway. I made a quick room assessment based on her apparent love of vintage clothing. &#x201c;Zelda, let&#x2019;s put Ms. Chevalier in <i>Pounce</i>.&#x201d; Unless I missed my guess, she would love the pink cabbage drapes and the old-fashioned feel of the room. &#x201c;Ms. Chevalier, what is your cat&#x2019;s name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Mewer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like <i>The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir</i>? That&#x2019;s cute.&#x201d;</p><p>Eva smiled. &#x201c;Thank you. It&#x2019;s M-E-W-E-R, of course. I have a fondness for both 1960s TV shows and puns. The name came from Mrs. Mewer&#x2019;s tendency to talk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Mewer will enjoy <i>Pounce</i>, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;</p><p>Zelda nudged me. &#x201c;Where should I put Mr. Fischbein?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Move him to <i>Hike</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What peculiar names for rooms. Do you have an aversion to numbers?&#x201d; inquired Eva.</p><p>&#x201c;Like the town of Wagtail, the Sugar Maple Inn is pet-friendly, so we&#x2019;ve changed all the room names to reflect pet-related activities,&#x201d; I explained.</p><p>A small man whom I&#x2019;d barely noticed separated himself from the other ghost hunters, stepped closer, held up his forefinger, and murmured softly, &#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;m Felix Fischbein. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I brought my dog? I was told that was okay?&#x201d;</p><p>Eva turned to him with a devilish expression. &#x201c;Mr. Fischbein, we meet at last.&#x201d;</p><p>Fischbein&#x2019;s Adam&#x2019;s apple bobbed. He stuck out a stiff hand to shake hers, his shoulders pulling tight as though he was cringing inside. He forced a smile, one corner of his mouth twitching with doubt. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard a lot about you.&#x201d; Fischbein shot a glance at one of his friends, a pudgy man who glared at Eva.</p><p>Fischbein shoved hair out of his forehead with his palm in a nervous gesture. &#x201c;Your reputation precedes you.&#x201d; Even his Weimaraner backed away from Eva.</p><p>Eva cast a critical eye at the pudgy guy. &#x201c;I imagine it does.&#x201d; She turned to us again. &#x201c;I love it when ghost hunters quiver in my presence.&#x201d;</p><p>Uh-oh. Did I sense tension? &#x201c;<i>Hike</i> is a terrific room, Mr. Fischbein, and we&#x2019;re very happy that you brought your dog.&#x201d; That worked out well. He must not have informed us that he was bringing a dog. No matter. Problem solved. Plus we had moved away from the argument about ghosts.</p><p>And then Casey returned and had to go and say, &#x201c;It was definitely a ghost.&#x201d;</p><p>Zelda, who fancied herself a pet psychic, whispered, &#x201c;Bet she doesn&#x2019;t believe in psychics, either.&#x201d;</p><p>Oh no. Not what we needed right now.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with my hearing,&#x201d; Eva announced. &#x201c;But you are quite right. Psychics prey on those who haven&#x2019;t the intelligence to know better. They&#x2019;re nothing more than modern-day snake oil salesmen.&#x201d; Eva gathered her cat into her arms.</p><p>Zelda stiffened. &#x201c;Mrs. Mewer wants you to know that she&#x2019;s afraid of the vultures.&#x201d;</p><p>Eva glanced up at the antler chandelier before frowning at Zelda. &#x201c;Which way is my room, please?&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Mewer hunched her back and dug her claws into Eva&#x2019;s unfortunate wool coat, ducking and twisting her head so she could keep an eye on the vulture decorations overhead.</p><p>I hoped Zelda and Casey wouldn&#x2019;t high-five in front of Eva. I hurried to change the subject. &#x201c;Would you like a GPS locating collar for Mrs. Mewer&#x2019;s use during her stay?&#x201d;</p><p>Eva pondered for a moment. &#x201c;No. She&#x2019;s very good at walking on a leash.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t dare trust Zelda or Casey to show Eva to her room. They were bound to argue with her about ghosts and psychics.</p><p>&#x201c;Would you keep an eye on Trixie?&#x201d; I asked them. </p><p>I handed Eva her welcome packet. &#x201c;This way, please.&#x201d; I picked up her bags and led the way into the main part of the inn, past the large sitting room and the grand staircase. Someone had gone overboard with the decorations. A mummy stood guard on each side of the staircase. Candles flickered on assorted black iron stands, and a trio of faux, oversized black cats hissed at us.</p><p>I pointed at the busy tables in the dining area. &#x201c;We serve breakfast, lunch, and afternoon tea, as well as light dishes by room service on request. There&#x2019;s a menu in your room, and a cat menu for Mrs. Mewer. I believe Mr. Luciano has made special arrangements for most of your meals. Breakfast is here at the inn at your convenience, and there&#x2019;s a welcome reception for you at five o&#x2019;clock this afternoon in the Dogwood Room.&#x201d; We walked through the library and into the newly built cat wing.</p><p>I unlocked the door and switched on the overhead light, gesturing for Eva to enter. If she was distressed by the conversation regarding her disbeliefs, she showed no sign of it, but I still debated apologizing for the staff. I probably should.</p><p>She lowered Mrs. Mewer to the bed and turned around in the center of the spacious guest room, taking it in with a dreamy expression. &#x201c;This is lovely. Thank you for changing my room. I have no idea what the other room looks like, of course, but it couldn&#x2019;t be any more perfect than this.&#x201d;</p><p>Pink and red cabbage roses on a soft blue background graced the drapes and the goose-down comforter. The walls had been painted the palest blue and the wood floors had been whitewashed, a nice match with the white headboard, white tufted bench at the foot of the bed, and cozy white armchair near the fireplace. Over the top of the bed, in between paintings of cabbage roses, hung a framed quote in an artful gold script: <i>&#x201c;If man could be crossed with the cat it would improve the man, but it would deteriorate the cat.&#x201d; ~Mark Twain</i>.</p><p>An antique mahogany dressing table with a huge mirror and the delicate crystal chandelier that hung from the ceiling offered additional feminine touches.</p><p>Mrs. Mewer wasted no time in leaping to the catwalk that ran along the walls near the ceiling. She viewed us from above with haughty pleasure.</p><p>I strode over to the sliding glass doors and demonstrated how to lock the cat door to the porch. When I opened it, Mrs. Mewer zoomed through, evoking a cry of distress from Eva.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d; I unlatched the sliding glass door and walked out to the porch with Eva on my heels.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s securely enclosed with cat-proof screening.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Mewer had already climbed to the highest point of the tree that had been installed inside the porch just for feline guests. She rested on a branch like a panther, purring so loud that we couldn&#x2019;t mistake her contentment. A gentle wind blew, no doubt carrying the scents of squirrels and other woodland creatures.</p><p>&#x201c;This is amazing. Luciano told me that the Sugar Maple Inn offered special quarters for cats, but I never imagined anything like this. Is there a litter box?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In the bathroom. And I must apologize for Casey and Zelda. I&#x2019;m terribly sorry about their behavior.&#x201d;</p><p>Eva shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m used to it. Three out of four Americans believe in ghosts or some sort of supernatural activity. To do otherwise would destroy their hope in an afterlife. It&#x2019;s understandable that they wouldn&#x2019;t want to give up that dream, hence the continuing search for evidence which does not exist.&#x201d; She sighed. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t complain. I&#x2019;m augmenting my teaching income by proving it&#x2019;s all nonsense. The believers keep me employed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you for being so understanding. Give me a call if there&#x2019;s anything you need.&#x201d; As I left the room, Eva was examining the contents of her gift basket. Mrs. Mewer would be thrilled with the locally made toys and treats, and after her less-than-welcome reception, Eva would probably enjoy the bottle of Fat Cat wine.</p><p>I hurried back to help Zelda and Casey, but when I rushed into the registration lobby I stopped short.</p><p>A perfectly round, white circle was traveling slowly across the wall.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Two</p><p>Trixie broke the hush by barking and chasing the orb, while Gingersnap and the Weimaraner pranced after her.</p><p>Someone whispered, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got i...</p></p><h2>Tarot Spells (Llewellyn&#39;s New Age Tarot Series)</h2><p><p>Most people think that Tarot cards are only for doing readings.

Lewis and I had that fit....</i></p><p><i>How did we get that close? I think the wilderness had something to do with it. Lewis and I would have been close anywhere, but the wilderness brought out the best in both of us. We were made for that territory."</i></p><p> In 1803, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark set off on a journey to explore the vast territory of the United States west of the Mississippi River. Accompanying Lewis and Clark and their team of explorers through this uncharted wilderness was Lewis' dog Seaman.</p><p><i>Lewis and Clark and Me </i>is Seaman's story. From his first meeting with Lewis, to being mistaken for a bear by Indians who had never seen such a large dog, to his encounters with wild animals both familiar and unfamiliar, Seaman's tales are filled with the joys of companionship and the tingling excitement of adventure. </p><p>Seaman's stories are based information provided in the explorers' journals. The book include many of these direct quotes from the original text as well as a detailed map showing the highlights of this amazing expedition.</p></p><p><p>Laurie Myers is the author of several well-received books for intermediate readers. An avid dog lover, she collaborated on a collection of stories, <i>My Dog, My Hero</i>, with her mother Betsy Byars and sister, Betsy Duffey. Ms. Myers lives with her family in Augusta, Georgia.</p><p>Michael Dooling has illustrated many books on historical figures including Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. To research <i>Lewis and Clark and Me</i> he spent time with a group that reenacted the Lewis and Clark expedition. He and his family live in Audubon, New Jersey.</p>Gr. 3-6. The Lewis and Clark expedition spent more than two years exploring the territory west of the Mississippi River accompanied by Meriwether Lewis' huge Newfoundland dog, Seaman. Myers describes the extraordinary journey through Seaman's perspective, using the dog to remember several of his adventures in a descriptive, first-person voice. Each of Seaman's stories is followed by Lewis' journal entry describing the event. Seaman served as hunter, retriever, and guard dog as well as a peacemaker with the Indians, and his story offers an interesting perspective on a familiar piece of U.S. history. Beautifully detailed oil paintings bring each story to life, and a double-page map shows the expedition's route. An afterword explains a misunderstanding about the dog's name, Seaman's epitaph, and his reaction to Lewis' death in 1809.

It&#x2019;s made from lime and hemp shivs (a waste product from hemp fiber growing); it can be used for walls, floors, and for roof insulation; it&#x2019;s breathable, absorbing and emitting moisture to regulate internal humidity and avoid trapped moisture and mold growth; it provides excellent acoustic and thermal insulation and thermal mass; it&#x2019;s lightweight and reduces construction costs; and it&#x2019;s environmentally friendly&#x2014;it locks up CO2 for the life of the building, and the hemp doesn&#x2019;t require agrochemicals or insecticides in its cultivation. This book is a detailed practical manual for professionals and self-builders, detailing how to source and make hempcrete and other hemp-lime composites, and how to use them in new builds and restoration. <i>The Hempcrete Book</i> provides a full explanation of construction techniques, highlighting potential pitfalls and how to avoid them, and includes a comprehensive resources section and examples of completed builds, with design notes.</p></p><p><p><b>William Stanwix</b> is a qualified building surveyor and founder of Hemp-LimeConstruct, a growing UK company that specializes in new building and restoration with hempcrete and hemp-lime composite materials. <b>Alex Sparrow</b> works for Hemp-LimeConstruct, one of only a handful of companies working with hempcrete in the UK, and is a freelance writer on natural building.</p>"The book contains lots of good advice and general good building practice...

With a background in Vedanta and Catholic Christianity, as well as the natural sciences, she has developed a broad, inclusive vision of human reality in its cosmic and social contexts. Analyzing the systemic and metaphysical roots of our social inequities, she offers an alternative worldview, featuring the incomparable value of each person and the community dynamics of mutual respect and care that follow from that view. This theme is developed as global spirituality, not limited to any particular religious tradition but accessible in direct human terms common to all. <p>Dr. Bruteau has published twelve books and more than one hundred articles. Her essays have appeared in journals such as International Philosophical Quarterly, Cross Currents, and Cistercian Studies.</p>In Radical Optimism, Beatrice Bruteau sets forth a deep and shining vision of spirituality, one that guides the reader into the contemplative life and the very root of our being. Dr. Bruteau is a philosopher of great measure whose work should be required reading for all who seek the deepest truth about themselves.<br> (Sue Monk Kidd, author of When the Heart Waits)<br><br>In the preface to this second edition of Radical Optimism (first published in 1993) Beatrice Bruteau notes, 'There are terrorists abroad in the world with dreadful weapons in their reach, and there is a System in place in the world which-almost unnoticed-has gained control of the fundamentals of life; food, jobs, welfare, security, health and safety measures... We need, urgently, to consider all over again what our life is about and what values are important... We need to find our way back to the basic realities, truths, values.'<br><br>The book focuses on leisure; stillness; meditation; the finite and the infinite; sin and salvation; the heart of Jesus, root of reality; the communion of saints; and Trinitarian manifestation. <br><br>The chapters on leisure, stillness and meditation form the strength of the book and are presented as effective forces that confront evil. She encourages a spirit of optimism, and observes that most of the spiritual life is a matter of relaxing, of being still and open. <br><br>Radical Optimism presents deeply religious practices all within the context of ordinary demands of life; for example, if we were to make a list of our activities and then ask ourselves whether we really need to do each of them we might be amazed at what we could strike from the list. We can be peaceful even in the demands of contemporary life, because what is really pressuring us is the insistence of our own demands. <br><br>She makes a distinction between wishing and willing. Wishing admits we believe that we cannot change something. It leaves us without energy. Willing commutes us to the belief that a situation can be changed by us. It brings peace and releases energy which is focused on positive energy. Radical Optimism shows us who we are and what we can do about the evil and suffering in the world and our own lives.<br> (Ann Lynch <i>Catholic Library Review</i>)<br><br>This is a timely reissue of one of the best books by Beatrice Bruteau, Catholic mystic and founder of the Schola Contemplationis. When Dr. Bruteau writes, the wise Theosophist should run to the local bookshop. Having been trained in the contemplantive traditions of Catholicism, Advaita Vedanta, and higher mathematics, she offers a potent synthesis, grounded in serious spiritual practice, and appropriate to modern life.<br><br>This book is both philosophically serious and practically focused, with lots of suggestions for exercises. Both newcomers to the spiritual path and seasoned veterans of the quest will find food for the journey here. Dr. Bruteau reaches sermonic heights at moments, challenging us to grow past the comfortable:<br><br>'But what else is the contemplative life for? It is where the great risks can be faced, where folkloric religion can be outgrown and the naked Reality entered into by naked spirit. In the depths of the contemplative life, there should no longer be any secrets, any euphemisms, any tales told to children, but the way should be clear to find the Real beyond finite descriptions' (93).<br><br>Dr. Bruteau also makes a compelling case for the inner life lived fully in the modern world, expressed through compassionate action. By sharing in the unselfish abundance of the Divine, we are transformed, and then begin to live differently.<br><br>'Contemplation is not something that is done alongside or before or after our everyday action. It&#x2019;s the doing itself that is contemplation because you yourself are so united with God that you are simply living the divine life; you are God living and doing you in the world. You are God&#x2019;s manifestation' (132).<br><br>While some of Dr. Bruteau&#x2019;s fellow Christians may find this 'strong meat' indeed, it is a rich feast of a book, and we should thank her for setting the table.<br> (John Plummer <i>The Quest</i>)<br><br>Christian philosopher and founder of a network for contemplatives, Bruteau writes with clarity and insight about true reality, and of our need to see ourselves as we are at that core, rather than looking always at ourselves on the periphery. She puts concerns for leisure or Sabbath-time into the context not only of focusing on essence but also of stilling mind and body so that the type of mediation that sees the biblical stories as our own, the Annunciation as our own annunciation, may flourish. Her meditations on sin, salvation, Jesus, the communion of the saints, and the Trinity are similarly profound and relational. Highly recommended, especially for seminary and public libraries, but for academic ones as well. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>'Here comes that dreamer!' Joseph&#x2019;s brothers said with contempt. Yet, the Book of Genesis tells us also how the life of a whole people was saved by this dreamer&#x2019;s dreams. Beatrice Bruteau shows us that the life of a whole world&#x2014;ours&#x2014;may depend on learning to dream radical and realistic dreams. At last, a book that offers solid metaphysical underpinnings for contemplation. (Brother David Steindl-Rast, O.S.B., senior member of Mount Savior Monastery, active participant in and author of several works on Buddhist-Christian dialogue)<br><br>Radical Optimism goes to the root reality required to meet the vast challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. Only as we tap into the Great Creative Process of the universe through direct inner knowing, or contemplation, can we be energized by the impulse of evolution itself. Beatrice Bruteau is a vital awakener of our ability to make the effort to move us to the next stage of our evolution. (Barbara Marx Hubbard, author of Emergence: The Shift from Ego to Essence)<br><br>A gifted philosopher, mathematician, mystical theologian, and practical spiritual teacher with a vigorous mind and open heart presents a vision of cultivating contemplative awareness. Beatrice Bruteau is one of the great writers of our time. (Wayne Teasdale)<br><br>Dr. Bruteau&#x2019;s Radical Optimism is a spiritual classic. It offers practical contemplative techniques to quiet the mind and a vision for bringing healing to ourselves, others, and our planet, rooted in Western and Eastern religious traditions. A must read for all spiritual seekers. (Lewis D.

Offering a scientifically informed perspective on canines and their relations with humans, the Coppingers take a close look at eight different types of dogs&#x2014;household, village, livestock guarding, herding, sled-pulling, pointing, retrieving, and hound. They argue that dogs did not evolve directly from wolves, nor were they trained by early humans; instead they domesticated themselves to exploit a new ecological niche: Mesolithic village dumps. Tracing the evolution of today's breeds from these village dogs, the Coppingers show how characteristic shapes and behaviors&#x2014;from pointing and baying to the sleek shapes of running dogs&#x2014;arise from both genetic heritage and the environments in which pups are raised.<br> <br> For both dogs and humans to get the most out of each other, we need to understand and adapt to the biological needs and dispositions of our canine companions, just as they have to ours.<br></p></p><p><b>Raymond Coppinger</b> is a professor of biology at Hampshire College.

After a long layover in Seattle for the middle book, <i>Knight of the Word</i>, the fantasy-meets-modernity action returns to Nest's native Hopewell, where once again Nest and John must face off against the Void, this time in the form of ancient demon Findo Gask, who favors a black-clad evil preacher getup for his menacing needs.<p> Brooks's well-realized and likable cast from the previous books is back, from Nest (now 29) to Ross (haggard as ever) to Pick (still just a few inches tall) and even grown-up versions of Nest's childhood friends from <i>Running</i>, including Bennett, now a junkie with child. Of course, Findo Gask has assembled a creepy little Legion of Doom to harry these nice folks: a giant albino demon; a formless, flesh-eating <i>ur'droch</i>; and a knife-wielding Orphan-Annie-gone-bad named Penny Dreadful.

But applying a single, one-size-fits-all method of exegesis can lead to confusion and misunderstanding. A valuable reference tool for students and pastors, the Handbooks for Old Testament Exegesis (HOTE) series provides readers with an enhanced understanding of different Old Testament genres and strategies for interpretation. The inaugural volume in the HOTE series, Interpreting the Historical Books begins by exploring the components of narrative-setting, characterization, and plot-and then develops the major theological themes in each of the Old Testament historical books (Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1-2 Samuel, 1-2 Kings, 1-2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther). As readers work through Interpreting the Historical Books, they will begin to see and interpret the narrative writings as the writings were intended to be understood. A glossary defining technical words and samples of moving from exegesis to proclamation make this handbook practical and user-friendly. All written by accomplished teacher-scholars at leading evangelical schools, forthcoming handbooks include the following: Interpreting the Psalms Mark D. Futato (Reformed Theological Seminary, Orlando) Interpreting the Prophets Michael A. Grisanti (The Master&#39;s Seminary) Interpreting the Wisdom Literature Richard L. Schultz (Wheaton College) Interpreting Apocalyptic Literature Richard A. Taylor (Dallas Theological Seminary) Interpreting the Pentateuch Peter T. Vogt (Bethel Seminary)</p><p><p>Robert B.

He is a translator and the Senior Old Testament Editor of the NET Bible. Chisholm&#x2019;s other publications include <em>Interpreting the Minor Prophets, Handbook on the Prophets,</em> and <em>A Workbook for Intermediate Hebrew.</em></p>The strength of Interpreting the Historical Books is Chisholm�s skill at articulating and illustrating a reading strategy for Hebrew based exegesis. Too many seminary students spend semesters learning the rudiments of the biblical languages, but never learn how to apply the knowledge that they have gained to the actual practice of interpretation. A careful reading of Interpreting the Historical Books will empower the student to deploy her understanding of Hebrew for a deeper engagement with the biblical text than is possible for those who rely only on English translations.

How I wish Handbooks for Old Testament Exegesis: Interpreting the Historical Books (Kregel) had been available during my formative years of training. It provides a wealth of information, tools, and samples for anyone interested in understanding and proclaiming biblical narrative. Knowledge of the biblical languages can be a great step forward in navigating the objective truth. Invitation to Biblical Hebrew: A Beginning Grammar could offer a great refresher course for those whose first year of Hebrew is in the foggy past. For those who already know the difference between a Hiphil or Niphal, a Workbook for Intermediate Hebrew will take you farther into your journey into the original languages. This workbook teaches syntactical analysis of the Hebrew text.

It is also the first memoir by a woman Holocaust survivor and establishes the model for understanding the gendered Nazi policies and practices targeting Jewish women as racially poisonous. Perl&#x2019;s memoir is also significant for its inclusion of the Nazis&#x2019; Roma victims as well as in-depth representations of Nazi women guards and other personnel. Unlike many important Holocaust memoirs, Perl&#x2019;s writing is both graphic in its horrific detail and eloquent in its emotional responses. One of the memoir&#x2019;s major historical contributions is Perl&#x2019;s account of being forced to work alongside Dr. Josef Mengele in his infamous so-called clinic and using her position to save the lives of other women prisoners. These efforts including infanticide and abortion, topics that would remain silenced for decades and, unfortunately, continue to be marginalized from all too many Holocaust accounts. After decades out of print, this new edition will ensure the crucial place of Perl&#x2019;s testimony on Holocaust memory and education.</p><p>Phyllis Lassner is professor emerita in the Crown Family Center for Jewish and Israel Studies at Northwestern University.

Cohen is associate professor of instruction at Northwestern University&#x2019;s School of Education and Social Policy and the Crown Family Center for Jewish and Israel Studies.Lassner and Cohen deserve praise and gratitude for pursuing and bringing to fruition the republication of I Was a Doctor in Auschwitz. One of the first published by an Auschwitz survivor, Perl&#x2019;s memoir not only recounts the horrors of existence in Auschwitz, which included grave moral challenges and efforts to resist, but also engages many of the questions that have shaped the field of Holocaust Studies. Lassner and Cohen serve the reader well with their outstanding introduction that contextualizes Perl&#x2019;s memoir in the history and the historiography of the Holocaust, particularly as related to understandings of women&#x2019;s experiences. They also chose wisely to end the new edition with a poignant essay by Eva Hoffman. Students and scholars alike will benefit from this new edition for years to come. (Sarah M.

Called &#34;the house of self-undoing&#34; by the old astrologers, this house has signified sorrow, misfortune, illness, imprisonment and secret enmity. It does, however, mean much more than that. Karen Hamaker-Zondag considers this house from the perspective of a Jungian psychologist, and shows the creative potential that can be tapped here if we choose to cooperate with it. The 12th house symbolizes the collective unconscious and non-rational ways of perception--such as working with dreams. The effect of planets in the 12th house and how to work with them, they way in which the house reveals parental/ancestral inheritance, the working of fate and unconscious processes are all discussed in detail. The book offers a clear and intriguing interpretation of this difficult to understand house and will be of value to students at all levels, particularly those who want to combine psychological theory with astrological symbolism.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Dutch</p><h2>The Friend</h2><p><p><b>The chilling psychological thriller from the #1 bestselling author of <i>I Am Watching You</i>.</b></p><p>On a train with her husband, miles from home and their four-year-old son, Ben, Sophie receives a chilling phone call.

He hits upon this ultimate truth by developing his notion of human history and events as "a procession of delusions," striking out at the so-called "Fallacies of Hope."

Educators are sending a clear, urgent message to local, state, and federal governments and the public: Student learning will not be maximized until student social emotional wellness is prioritized.<br> &nbsp;<br> All students deserve our best &#x2013; and especially those who experience racial inequity, toxic stressors, cultural invalidation, homelessness, and other trauma. Today&#x2019;s students deserve teachers who care about their overall wellness as much or even more than their academic well-being and success. Yet inequities abound, and the most vulnerable students who most need resources are often the least likely to receive such support.<br> &nbsp;<br> So how can we ensure that all students thrive? By building and sustaining the critical wellness approach shared in <i>All Students Must Thrive</i>. This book brings together three theoretical frameworks relevant for equity in schools &#x2013; wellness, critical pedagogy, and critical race theory &#x2013; providing a structure through which to apply the authors&#x2019; strategies and approaches. Offering a multilayered approach to supporting students and their families holistically, this book helps educators of all levels nurture the social emotional wellness that is essential for all students to thrive.<br><br> Are you ready to transform today&#x2019;s schools into tomorrow&#x2019;s hubs of learning? Whether you are an educator in a small rural, large urban, or midsize suburban district &#x2013; whether the student population is largely socioeconomically disadvantaged, racially segregated, or a balanced mosaic from diverse backgrounds &#x2013; this book will help you understand how to demonstrate to students that they do matter, that their wellness is essential, and that they can thrive in their quest to learn.<br> &nbsp;<br> It will not be easy work; it will not happen overnight. But you can make a difference in these student&#x2019;s lives. You can disrupt teacher apathy to catalyze change. You can challenge the status quo and reimagine the outdated educational models of the past, helping to create strategic alliances and ecosystems of support that refuse to allow students to fall through the cracks. You can transform our schools and help our students reach their full potential &#x2013; especially those often overlooked and underserved.<br> &nbsp;<br> So be bold. Be courageous. Be reflective and dedicate yourself to improving leadership, practice, policy and research that benefits our students. Keep fighting, protesting, praying, and working until all of our students have the education they deserve &#x2013; because they are worth it.</p><p><p>Tyrone C.

Visit the group&#x2019;s website at studiojuliakay.com/jkpp.<b>ABOUT Julia kay&#x2019;s portrait party</b><br><br>Julia Kay&#x2019;s Portrait Party (JKPP) is an international collaborative project in which artists all over the world make portraits of each other. After seven years of exchanging portraits, tips, and techniques with each other, we&#x2019;re now sharing our art, our words and our inspiration with everyone who is interested in or would like to get started with portraiture.<br><br> JKPP began in 2010 as a way to celebrate the successful completion of my three-year project to make a self-portrait every day. During that project I experimented with multiple media and conceptions of &#x201c;self-portrait.&#x201d; I drew while looking in the mirror, from photographs, from memory and from imagination. I painted in my studio and drew with my finger on my iPod&nbsp;Touch. In all this experimentation, the thing that emerged as the most important to me was my commitment to a daily art-making practice. I had never had that in my life before, and it was terrific. After three years, I was ready to stop putting myself in every picture, but I wasn&#x2019;t ready to stop drawing every day.<br><br> As a transition between staring at my own face for three years and opening up to other genres entirely, I thought it would be fun to throw a portrait party and look at some other faces. I&#x2019;d first heard of portrait parties from Rama Hughes&#x2019;s blog, where he described a portrait party as a get-together where artists draw each other. Originally I thought I would have a traditional live portrait party.&nbsp;<br><br>Unfortunately, as the three years of my self-portraits were winding up, I found myself in the middle of a family emergency and in no position to throw a live party. I&#x2019;d begun posting my work and following other artists on flickr.com so I decided to try starting a group there. I sent invites to some of the other self-portrait and figurative artists I&#x2019;d been interacting with, crossed my fingers, and hoped a couple of people would post photos by the time I was ready to start, a week later.<br><br> Apparently I wasn&#x2019;t the only self-portrait artist in the world hungry for another face to stare at. In that first week, before I even began drawing anyone myself, 60 artists jumped on board and drew more than 200 portraits of each other. After six weeks, we had 150 members from around the world who had posted more than 1,300 portraits of each other. By the time of this book&#x2019;s publication, we had more than 1,000 members from more than 55 countries, and the group had produced more than 50,000 portraits of each other.<br><br>As the portrait count was growing, the group was also growing closer as a community. Group members were using the Flickr interface to comment extensively on each other&#x2019;s work, have conversations about different art processes, tell jokes. There was an inadvertently funny moment early on, when one of the digital artists asked a watercolorist &#x201c;What app did you use for that?&#x201d; Usually the digital artists posted to digital groups and the watercolorists posted to watercolor groups, so they weren&#x2019;t used to seeing each other&#x2019;s work. But here artists in all media were mixing it up and being inspired by each&nbsp;other. A wide range of styles also emerged&#x2014;from realistic likenesses to wild semi-abstracts that are perhaps only conceptually portraits. Of course you&#x2019;ll see this range of styles and media throughout the book, but to whet your appetite, here you can see two portraits in very different styles from the same photo of Lena, Norway.<br><br> In addition to a growing body of work and a growing community, the group has had growing recognition. Many individual artists exhibit, publish and sell their JKPP portraits. We&#x2019;ve been invited to participate in portrait-themed exhibits and portrait events. Several JKPP group exhibits have been held, in locations from the USA to the UK, including a month-long exhibit in San Francisco culminating in a three-day international meetup to celebrate our 5th Anniversary.<br><br> The digital revolution was instrumental in bringing the artists of JKPP together. The advent of the internet enabled us to connect visually with each other over great distances. It has allowed artists from places as disparate as the USA and Iraq, the UK and South Korea, to exchange photos of ourselves for portraiture and to share our work, our ideas, and our advice.<br><br> Another part of the digital revolution also impacted JKPP. Art made on phones and tablets, known as mobile digital art, was gaining momentum as the party was starting. I was very interested in this medium from its inception, and was involved with the online community of artists exploring it. Within a month of JKPP starting, the first Apple iPad was released and mobile digital artists were freed from the tiny screens of their phones. The artists who came together at the inception of JKPP used media ranging from painting with brushes to painting with the Brushes app. Everyone was interested in all the different processes, and many artists were influenced by each other. Traditional artists&nbsp;started playing with iPads, and digital artists pulled dusty watercolor sets out of their closets.<br><br> I&#x2019;ve wondered if it&#x2019;s revolutionary to make a portrait&#x2014;thousands of portraits&#x2014;without having to worry about flattering or bestowing prestige on the subject, as artists commissioned to make portraits generally have to do. At JKPP, the members offer up their photos of themselves to be used by other artists to explore their own artistic interests. Although there are guidelines for being respectful, there&#x2019;s no requirement for a resemblance, or a flattering depiction.<br><br> On the other side of the equation, historically, you had to be the queen, the pope, the prime minister, or at least a sports star to have so many portraits made of you. But at JKPP, hundreds of people without exceptional fame have had the experience of not just one, two, or three portraits of themselves, but dozens, even hundreds.<br> In this book, you will find hundreds of portraits by and of artists from all over the world. Our portraits are in a wide range of media, including digital and traditional&#x2014;and some that fall in neither category. Styles range from colorful to monochrome, realistic to abstract. Themes such as artists at work and play show that a portrait can be more than head and shoulders. The range of interpretations is illustrated with different artists&#x2019; portraits of the same subject, often from the same photo. Conversely, the development of distinct styles is seen in the Featured Artist pages. I hope you enjoy what you see here, and get inspired to make some portraits yourself. And I hope it leaves you wanting to see more, at http://studiojuliakay.com/jkpp.<br><br>JULIA L.

He teaches environmental writing and journalism at Stanford University's School of Earth Science. Hayden resides in San Francisco with his family.Lloyd James sounds like the character whose memories hes reading, the same age and with the voice one might expect from a young doctor--quiet but assertive. Capitalizing on the excitement of stories written by a surgeon in a war zone, the narration ceases to exist as well-painted mental images replace the words. Every once in a while James gives a little laugh or imitates a drill instructor, adding to but not upstaging the story. As battalion medical officer, while under heavy fire, Dr. Jadick helped his corpsmen staunch the bleeding when dozens of casualties surrounded them. His tales of life at war mingled with the agonies of familial estrangement could portray any GI in Iraq. J.A.H.

What makes us sad? How do we come to feel a sense of enthusiasm? What fills us with lust, anger, fear, or tenderness? Traditional behavioral and cognitive neuroscience have yet to provide satisfactory answers. <em>The Archaeology of Mind</em> presents an affective neuroscience approach&#x2015;which takes into consideration basic mental processes, brain functions, and emotional behaviors that all mammals share&#x2015;to locate the neural mechanisms of emotional expression. It reveals&#x2015;for the first time&#x2015;the deep neural sources of our values and basic emotional feelings.</p><p>This book elaborates on the seven emotional systems that explain how we live and behave. These systems originate in deep areas of the brain that are remarkably similar across all mammalian species. When they are disrupted, we find the origins of emotional disorders:</p><p>- SEEKING: how the brain generates a euphoric and expectant response</p><p>- FEAR: how the brain responds to the threat of physical danger and death</p><p>- RAGE: sources of irritation and fury in the brain</p><p>- LUST: how sexual desire and attachments are elaborated in the brain</p><p>- CARE: sources of maternal nurturance</p><p>- GRIEF: sources of non-sexual attachments</p><p>- PLAY: how the brain generates joyous, rough-and-tumble interactions</p><p>- SELF: a hypothesis explaining how affects might be elaborated in the brain</p><p>The book offers an evidence-based evolutionary taxonomy of emotions and affects and, as such, a brand-new clinical paradigm for treating psychiatric disorders in clinical practice.</p></p><p><p><strong>Jaak Panksep</strong><strong>p, PhD</strong>, was the Baily Endowed Chair of Animal Well-Being Science at Washington State University's College of Veterinary Medicine, emeritus Distinguished Professor in the Department of Psychology at Bowling Green State University, and the Head of Northwestern University's Falk Center for Molecular Therapeutics.</p><p><strong>Lucy Biven</strong> trained at the Anna Freud Centre in London, and has served as Head of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy at the Leicestershire National Health Service in England.

Have you been feeling chronically tired and listless? Do you have a health problem your doctor can&#x2019;t identify? The cause may be parasites in your body. If you think that parasitic diseases happen only to people in Third World Countries, think again. The rate of parasite-related disorders in North American is skyrocketing.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this completely revised and updated edition of the most authoritative book on the subject for consumers, renowned nutritionist Ann Louise Gittleman gives the information you need to know to ward off unwelcome organisms. <i>Guess What Came to Dinner? </i>explains what parasites are, why they are harmful, and how they are spread. Most importantly, she offers tips on creating a parasite-proof diet and lifestyle. <i>What Came to Dinner? </i>is the indispensible guide to protecting yourself and your loved ones from this hidden epidemic.</p><p>Ann Louise Gittleman, M.S., CNS, received her master&#x2019;s degree in nutrition education from Columbia University Teachers College.

She lives in Montana.<b>introduction</b><p>Do you feel tired most of the time? Are you experiencing digestive problems&#x2014;gas, bloating, constipation or diarrhea&#x2014;that come and go but never really clear up? Do you suffer from food sensitivities and environmental intolerances? Have you developed allergic-like reactions and can&#x2019;t understand why? Are you depressed? Do you have difficulty gaining or losing weight no matter what you do? Have you even tried a yeast control program that helped to some degree but know you can&#x2019;t stay away from bread, alcohol, fruit, and fruit juices all your life? Do you sense something is not quite right with you but just can&#x2019;t figure out the cause&#x2014;and, for that matter, neither can your doctor?</p><p>If these symptoms and feelings sound familiar, then you may be an unsuspecting victim of the parasite epidemic that is affecting millions of Americans. It is an epidemic that knows no territorial, economic, or sexual boundaries. It is a silent epidemic of which most doctors in this country are not even aware. Yet, according to parasite expert and medical researcher Louis Parrish, M.D., at least eight out of ten of his patients have some kind of parasite infection.</p><p>Here is the untold story that finally solves the mystery of many chronic health disorders. It is a story that began for me back in 1974 when I stumbled upon the connection between parasites and disease. In that year, at a special class for the study of &#x201c;scientific nutrition&#x201d; in Albuquerque, New Mexico, instructor Hazel Parcells, D.C., N.D., Ph.D., introduced the topic of worms in a most visual manner. She showed the class various preserved specimens of internal visitors that had been passed by patients undergoing treatment for a wide array of unresolved health problems. I have never forgotten the sight of those little bottles and what was in them. For the next two years, I refused to eat in any restaurants&#x2014;for reasons you will read about later in this book. But most important, what I learned from Dr. Parcells was that worms, from the microscopic amoeba to the feet-long tapeworm, are a fundamental root cause of disease and are associated with health problems that go far beyond gastrointestinal-tract disturbances.</p><p>Since then, in my own nutritional practice, I have observed that many unexplained health conditions often disappeared when parasites were eliminated from the body. These conditions included environmental illness, skin problems, digestive problems, excessive fatigue, hypoglycemia, arthritic-like aches and pains, long-standing obesity, and even depression. Painstaking examination of my clients&#x2019; food habits, favorite ethnic restaurants, lifestyle, and travel records often revealed the source of infection. I was amazed to find that a patient&#x2019;s travel history was often the missing key to unlocking the underlying cause of persistent flu-like symptoms, allergy, fatigue, gas, and intermittent constipation and diarrhea. Frequently, symptoms started shortly after a vacation to tropical islands, Asia, or South America or a camping trip in Colorado.</p><p>A central problem in solving the parasite puzzle is that many parasite-based illnesses can mimic diseases more familiar to the doctor. Roundworm infection, for example, has been misdiagnosed as peptic ulcer, and amoebic colitis is often mislabeled as ulcerative colitis. Chronic fatigue syndrome and yeast infection may really be a case of chronic giardiasis, while diabetes and hypoglycemia can be caused by tapeworm infection. The majority of doctors in the United States do not recognize parasites and therefore do not diagnose them. This may be due to the fact that parasitology courses in medical schools are usually offered by a tropical diseases department, giving rise to the notion that parasites are primarily a foreign concern. Furthermore, the inability of technicians to accurately diagnose the problem compounds the issue. The parasites&#x2019; own reproductive cycle, in which eggs or cysts are passed at irregular intervals, also makes accurate diagnosis tricky.</p><p>Today, parasites and the diseases they cause are no longer found just in faraway places like the tropics&#x2014;places that conjure up images of poverty and poor hygiene. Some parasites, like giardia and pinworms, are, in fact, found predominantly in temperate climates. These organisms as well as others have become more prevalent in America because of a number of modern-day factors discussed throughout this book.</p><p>The idea of harboring a living organism inside our bodies is repulsive and unpleasant to dwell upon, but learning all we can about our unwelcome boarders is the only way we can discover enough to evict them and rid ourselves once and for all of their presence. This is one situation in which ignorance is definitely not bliss.<br><br><b>knowledge is the key</b></p><p>In this book I will tell you:</p><ul><li>which twentieth-century factors have increased the parasite risk in the United States.</li><li>what parasites look like and what symptoms to look for.</li><li>how parasites are transmitted through food, water, animals, sexual practices, and day-care centers.</li><li>how parasitic infections should be diagnosed.</li></ul><p>In the following chapters, you will find answers to such questions as:</p><ul><li>What are the most effective natural and medical treatments for parasitic infection?</li><li>How can my family and I prevent infection and reinfection?</li><li>What lifestyle and travel precautions should I take?</li></ul><p>The answers to these questions and many more may surprise and even shock you. But this book was written to do just that&#x2014;awaken you, your family, and your doctor to the fact that parasites are alive and well and thriving in America today. I wrote this book because as a health-care professional I am worried...worried that so many individuals are not well, even though they are following a balanced diet and a good exercise program, and are unable to find the reason. I am convinced, after dealing with patients for more than eighteen years, that one of the major reasons for the chronic ill health we are seeing today is none other than parasites.</p><p>After you read this book, I urge you to share it with as many people as you can. Pass it on to your neighborhood health clinic, the hospital emergency room, your personal physician, and to veterinarians, day-care centers, outdoor clubs, restaurant owners, and travel agents. Education is the most potent weapon against the parasite epidemic. It is my hope that Guess What Came to Dinner? will become a wake-up call for every individual living in America today.<br><br><b>1</b><br><br><b>what you don&#x2019;t know can hurt you</b></p><p><b>April 1999:</b> A tiny parasitic worm that bores into tadpoles and disturbs cells may be the cause of a large numbers of mysterious frog-leg deformities.</p><p><b>September 1998:</b> The parasite Cryptosporidium causes widespread water contamination in Sidney, Australia.</p><p><b>May 1997:</b> Business executives in Houston, Texas, fall prey to the parasite cyclospora after eating infected produce.</p><p><b>April 1997:</b> Centers for Disease Control estimates between 100,000 and 1,000,000 cases of Giardia lamblia occur each year.</p><p><b>October 1994:</b> NBC television program Dateline reports that unnecessary deaths and illnesses throughout New York City are the fault of cryptosporidium-contaminated water.</p><p><b>November 1993:</b> According to a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) press release, parasites in the U.S. affect millions.</p><p><b>Spring 1993:</b> As reported by the NIAID, 100 deaths and more than 400,000 residents become seriously ill in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, after the parasite cryptosporidium contaminated the water supply.</p><p><b>January 1993:</b> Several deaths and hundreds of others fall ill to an E. coli outbreak in Washington due to fast-food hamburgers.</p><p><b>September 1992:</b> Pork tapeworm cysts show up on the brains of four orthodox Jews: A feature story by the Associated Press zeroes in on the mystery.</p><p><b>Spring 1991:</b> U.S. suspects Gulf War GIs are carrying the parasitic disease leishmaniasis and stops them from donating blood!</p><p>Believe it or not, Americans today are host to more than 130 different kinds of parasites, ranging from microscopic organisms to foot-long tapeworms. Practically every imaginable kind of exotic parasitic disease has been found on our shores: African sleeping sickness, toxoplasmosis, schistosomiasis, giardiasis, amebiasis, filariasis&#x2014;unpronounceable to most of us, but potentially deadly nevertheless. Even malaria is making a comeback, with cases of this mosquito-borne tropical disease being reported as close to home as New Jersey, Virginia, Texas, and California.1</p><p>Parasites are an insidious public health threat in the United States today. Insidious because so very few people are talking about parasites, and even fewer people are listening. Insidious because of the common misconception, among physicians and the general public alike, that parasites occur only in tropical Third World countries, areas traditionally associated with malnutrition and poor hygienic practices. Insidious because physicians do not suspect, and therefore do not recognize, classic symptoms. And insidious because even if physicians are aware of the threat, most use outdated and inadequate testing procedures, which result in underdiagnosis.</p><p>Lack of education is to blame. In the United States, physicians are simply not educated in parasitology and are, therefore, inexperienced in recognizing common clinical symptoms. A doctor&#x2019;s introduction to parasitology may come from a chapter here and there in a microbiology course in medical school. If parasitology itself is taught at all, it is as a specialty in the department of tropical medicine at some universities. Courses in these departments are not often elected by medical students who believe they will not be seeing &#x201c;tropical medicine&#x201d; problems in their general practices in the United States.</p><p>Yet, times have changed and parasites are much more widespread than previously believed. An article appearing in the June 27, 1978, Miami Herald states that a nationwide survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in 1976 revealed that one in every six people selected at random had one or more parasites. The survey also pinpointed a parasite known as Giardia lamblia as the number-one culprit in water-borne disease. Louis Parrish, M.D., a New York City physician who specializes in parasites, wrote in 1991, &#x201c;Based upon my experience, I estimate in the New York metropolitan area that 25 percent of the population is infected....&#x201d;2 Projections for the year 2025 suggest that more than half of the 8.3 billion people on Earth will then be infected with parasitic diseases.3</p><p>Often regarded as opportunistic invaders, parasites have no respect for class boundaries. The publicized illnesses of celebrities like actor Yul Brynner, who became seriously ill from trichinosis after eating in a well-known New York restaurant, and tennis pro Martina Navratilova, who was affected by cat-transmitted toxoplasmosis, illustrate that we are all susceptible. Contaminated well water at some of this nation&#x2019;s most prestigious ski resorts has led to outbreaks of giardiasis, which goes to show that parasites can occur even in the seats of the mighty.<br><br><b>how did it happen?</b></p><p>A number of seemingly unrelated factors unique to the late twentieth century have contributed to the unrestrained parasite epidemic and added to the increased risk of parasitic infection. Some of these factors include:</p><ul><li>the rise in international travel.</li><li>the contamination of municipal and rural water supplies.</li><li>the increasing use of day-care centers.</li><li>the influx of refugee and immigrant populations from endemic areas.</li><li>the return of armed forces from overseas.</li><li>the continued popularity of household pets.</li><li>the increasing popularity of exotic regional foods.</li><li>the use of antibiotics and immunosuppressive drugs.</li><li>the sexual revolution.</li><li>the spread of AIDS.</li></ul><p>Let&#x2019;s examine each of these factors in detail.<br><br><b>INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL</b></p><p>Today more than ever before, American tourists are traveling to remote areas of the world. An affluent society is a mobile one. In 1990 alone, more than 390 million people worldwide made international trips for pleasure and/or business. Over 15 million of them were Americans, and half of these Americans traveled to Third World countries. More adventurous trips to exotic destinations like the Caribbean Islands and remote areas of Mexico, South America, Asia, Africa, China, and Israel have replaced the old-fashioned grand tour. We know that smallpox, cholera, and the plague have been eradicated, so we&#x2019;re safe.</p><p>Not so.</p><p>Unfortunately, travel can be fatal. As mentioned earlier, malaria, the most virulent of the parasitic diseases, is on the rise both here and abroad. Malaria is a ruthless killer, responsible for up to 2 million deaths per year in over 100 countries. The rise of this disease is partly due to the fact that mosquitoes have become resistant to DDT and other insecticides. And drug-resistant parasites have been found throughout South America, East Africa, and Southeast Asia. In parts of Thailand, the organism is resistant to every known drug, and the problem now presents a medical crisis.4There are many documented clinical cases of travelers, including businessmen and foreign exchange students, who had been infected in other countries but did not manifest symptoms until after their return home. In some of these cases, the disease was properly identified but by that time had progressed beyond the point of medical intervention, and the patients died.5</p><p>For the majority of us, less threatening conditions such as bouts of diarrhea are expected souvenirs of world travel. We pack out Pepto-Bismol right along with our passports and think nothing of it. Unless we go to St. Petersburg, Russia. Formerly known as Leningrad, this is &#x201c;Giardia City&#x201d; to visitors who go home with severe diarrhea, fevers, chills, muscle pain, and intestinal bloating. The cause: The city&#x2019;s tap water is infected with Giardia lamblia, a microscopic parasite. Visitors to Nepal are routinely stricken with severe cases of giardia, unaffectionately referred to as &#x201c;Delhi-Belly.&#x201d; Giardiasis, however, can do more than ruin your vacation. Symptoms of this illness can persist long after the vacation has ended. And it has been known to set the stage for unexplained conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue.6, 7</p><p>Besides returning with photographs of the Great Wall of China, travelers there return with internal hitchhikers in the form of roundworms caused by widespread agricultural use of night soil (human waste). Eggs are not found in stool samples until sixty to seventy-five days after initial infection. By this time, they have gone through their pulmonary phase, creating such symptoms as cough, wheezing, bronchial spasms, and increased mucus. Symptoms of the intestinal phase may mimic those of peptic ulcer but require an entirely different treatment regimen.</p><p>The International Travelers Hotline of the Atlanta-based CDC warns those traveling to Africa of the danger of bathing, wading, or swimming in fresh water that may be infested wit...</p></p><h2>The New Roget&#39;s Thesaurus in Dictionary Form: Revised Edition</h2><p>Published in hardcover as <b>The Penguin Roget's College Thesaurus in Dictionary Form</b>, this new paperback edition of the 20-million-copy bestselling thesaurus has been fully revised, expanded, and updated for the modern home, school, or office.</p><p>When the correct word or phrase is hanging just out of reach, this alphabetical thesaurus will inevitably come to the rescue.

It could just be, the author suggests, that what witnesses have taken to be flying saucers might instead be antigravity-aircraft prototypes, though he cautions that "the subject is too complex ... to conform to a single explanation."</p><p> And therein hangs a good part of this always interesting, if admittedly speculative, story, which, regardless of the truth of the matter (or, perhaps, antimatter), will appeal to techies and Trekkies alike. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p>&#x201c;An intriguing work of scientific speculation.

The generation of its original revolutionaries was fast dying; a second war with Great Britain had recently been settled; and expansionism was the mood of the day. The &#34;children of the founders,&#34; as Carol Sheriff calls this first 19th-century American generation, sought to make its mark with engineering projects that would further national growth and prove to Europe that the new nation &#34;played a leading role in God&#39;s plan to improve the earthly world.&#34; It did so in grand style with the Erie Canal, a huge waterway that linked Atlantic seaports with the Great Lakes. Sheriff&#39;s vigorous account of the canal&#39;s conception and building makes for an epic story and fascinating reading.The story of the Erie Canal is the story of industrial and economic progress between the War of 1812 and the Civil War.

Guided by the questions<em> How did the situation get this way?</em> and <em>How does it stay this way?</em>, Schwalbe tracks inequality from its roots to its regulation. With its lively combination of analysis and stories, <em>Rigging the Game</em> is an innovative tool for teaching about the inequalities of race, class, and gender. In the final chapter, "Escaping the Inequality Trap," Schwalbe helps students understand how inequality can be challenged and overcome.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael Schwalbe</strong> is Professor of Sociology at North Carolina State University.

Most antebellum southern Baptist churches allowed women and slaves to vote on membership matters and preferred populists preachers who addressed their appeals to the common person. Paradoxically no denomination could wield religious authority as zealously as the Baptists. Between 1785 and 1860 they ritually excommunicated forty to fifty thousand church members in Georgia alone. Wills demonstrates how a denomination of freedom-loving individualists came to embrace an exclusivist spirituality--a spirituality that continues to shape Southern Baptist churches in contemporary conflicts between moderates who urge tolerance and conservatives who require belief in scriptural inerrancy. Wills's analysis advances our understanding of the interaction between democracy and religious authority, and will appeal to scholars of American religion, culture, and history, as well as to Baptist observers.<br></p><p>Democracy has not always fostered anti-authoritarian individualism.

Jean Danielou discusses the mission of the angels by following a historical order, looking at guardian angels, the angels and the sacraments, the spiritual life, death, and the Second Coming.</p><p>From St. Augustine to John Henry Newman, the greatest among the saints and men of God have lived on familiar terms with the angels; and the Church has always accorded them a very large place in her theology. <p> Recent theologians have dwelt on dry questions about the nature of the angels, but the early Fathers of the Church, with the memory of Jesus fresh in their minds (and of the angels of whom He spoke often) were fascinated with the energetic action of the angels among men and the ways in which the angels have carried out that mission from the instant of Creation through the time of Jesus; and how they will continue their work even unto the end of time. </p><p> From the works of these early Fathers of the Church, the late French Cardinal Jean Dani lou has drawn forth threads of knowledge and wisdom which he has here woven into a lucid and bright tapestry that shows us who the ministering angels really are, and how in every instant and in every way they are working for your salvation and mine. </p><p> Here you'll find no sentimental cherubs: the Fathers knew that majesty and power cloak actual angels, which is why God gave them the formidable tasks of shepherding not only souls, but entire nations, and the motions of the entire material universe itself. </p><p> Open these pages to meet the glorious angels as they were known by the Church's greatest saints and theologians: Origen and Eusebius, and Sts. Basil, Ambrose, Methodius, Gregory of Nyssa, Clement of Alexandria, and John Chrysostom (among others). </p><p> Soon you, too, will find yourself on familiar terms with the angels, and they'll begin to play in your life the larger role that God intends them to play.</p>Jean Cardinal Danielou, S.J.

It was the first of June, but cold gusts bit at the hilltop citadelle as fiercely as deepest winter, shaking the windows with curses and winding through drafty halls with warning whispers. There was no escaping what was to come.</p> <p>For good or bad, the hours were closing in. I closed my eyes against the thought, knowing that soon the day would cleave in two, forever creating the before and after of my life, and it would happen in one swift act that I could no more alter than the color of my eyes.</p> <p>I pushed away from the window, fogged with my own breath, and left the endless hills of Morrighan to their own worries. It was time for me to meet my day.</p> <p>The prescribed liturgies passed as they were ordained, the rituals and rites as each had been precisely laid out, all a testament to the greatness of Morrighan and the Remnant from which it was born. I didn&#x2019;t protest. By this point, numbness had overtaken me, but then midday approached, and my heart galloped again as I faced the last of the steps that kept here from there.</p> <p>I lay naked, facedown on a stone-hard table, my eyes focused on the floor beneath me while strangers scraped my back with dull knives. I remained perfectly still, even though I knew the knives brushing my skin were held with cautious hands. The bearers were well aware that their lives depended on their skill. Perfect stillness helped me hide the humiliation of my nakedness as strange hands touched me.</p> <p>Pauline sat nearby watching, probably with worried eyes. I couldn&#x2019;t see her, only the slate floor beneath me, my long dark hair tumbling down around my face in a swirling black tunnel that blocked the world out&#x2014;except for the rhythmic rasp of the blades.</p> <p>The last knife reached lower, scraping the tender hollow of my back just above my buttocks, and I fought the instinct to pull away, but I finally flinched. A collective gasp spread through the room.</p> <p>&#x201c;Be still!&#x201d; my aunt Cloris admonished.</p> <p>I felt my mother&#x2019;s hand on my head, gently caressing my hair. &#x201c;A few more lines, Arabella. That&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;</p> <p>Even though this was offered as comfort, I bristled at the formal name my mother insisted on using, the hand-me-down name that had belonged to so many before me. I wished that at least on this last day in Morrighan, she&#x2019;d cast formality aside and use the one I favored, the pet name my brothers used, shortening one of my many names to its last three letters. <i>Lia.</i> A simple name that felt truer to who I was.</p> <p>The scraping ended. &#x201c;It is finished,&#x201d; the First Artisan declared. The other artisans murmured their agreement.</p> <p>I heard the clatter of a tray being set on the table next to me and whiffed the overpowering scent of rose oil. Feet shuffled around to form a circle&#x2014;my aunts, mother, Pauline, others who&#x2019;d been summoned to witness the task&#x2014;and mumbled prayers were sung. I watched the black robe of the priest brush past me, and his voice rose above the others as he drizzled the hot oil on my back. The artisans rubbed it in, their practiced fingers sealing in the countless traditions of the House of Morrighan, deepening the promises written upon my back, heralding the commitments of today and ensuring all their tomorrows.</p> <p><i>They can hope</i>, I thought bitterly as my mind jumped out of turn, trying to keep order to the tasks still before me, the ones written only on my heart and not a piece of paper. I barely heard the utterances of the priest, a droning chant that spoke to all of their needs and none of my own.</p> <p>I was only seventeen. Wasn&#x2019;t I entitled to my own dreams for the future?</p> <p>&#x201c;And for Arabella Celestine Idris Jezelia, First Daughter of the House of Morrighan, the fruits of her sacrifice and the blessings of&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>He prattled on and on, the endless required blessings and sacraments, his voice rising, filling the room, and then when I thought I could stand no more, his very words pinching off my airways, he stopped, and for a merciful sweet moment, silence rang in my ears. I breathed again, and then the final benediction was given.</p> <p>&#x201c;For the Kingdoms rose out of the ashes of men and are built on the bones of the lost, and thereunto we shall return if Heaven wills.&#x201d; He lifted my chin with one hand, and with the thumb of his other hand, he smudged my forehead with ashes.</p> <p>&#x201c;So shall it be for this First Daughter of the House of Morrighan,&#x201d; my mother finished, as was the tradition, and she wiped the ashes away with an oil-dipped cloth.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and lowered my head. <i>First Daughter.</i> Both blessing and curse. And if the truth be known, a sham.</p> <p>My mother laid her hand on me again, her palm resting on my shoulder. My skin stung at her touch. Her comfort came too late. The priest offered one last prayer in my mother&#x2019;s native tongue, a prayer of safekeeping that, oddly, wasn&#x2019;t tradition, and then she drew her hand away.</p> <p>More oil was poured, and a low, haunting singsong of prayers echoed through the cold stone chamber, the rose scent heavy on the air and in my lungs. I breathed deeply. In spite of myself, I relished this part, the hot oils and warm hands kneading compliance into knots that had been growing inside me for weeks. The velvet warmth soothed the sting of acid from the lemon mixed with dye, and the flowery fragrance momentarily swept me away to a hidden summer garden where no one could find me. If only it were that easy.</p> <p>Again, this step was declared finished, and the artisans stepped back from their handiwork. There was an audible gathering of breath as the final results on my back were viewed.</p> <p>I heard someone shuffle closer. &#x201c;I daresay he won&#x2019;t be looking long upon her back with the rest of that view at his disposal.&#x201d; A titter ran through the room. Aunt Bernette was never one to restrain her words, even with a priest in the room and protocol at stake. My father claimed I got my impulsive tongue from her, though today I&#x2019;d been warned to control it.</p> <p>Pauline took my arm and helped me to rise. &#x201c;Your Highness,&#x201d; she said as she handed me a soft sheet to wrap around myself, sparing what little dignity I had left. We exchanged a quick knowing glance, which bolstered me, and then she guided me to the full-length mirror, giving me a small silver hand mirror, that I might view the results too. I swept my long hair aside and let the sheet fall enough to expose my lower back.</p> <p>The others waited in silence for my response. I resisted drawing in a breath. I wouldn&#x2019;t give my mother that satisfaction, but I couldn&#x2019;t deny that my wedding kavah was exquisite. It did indeed leave me in awe. The ugly crest of the Kingdom of Dalbreck had been made startlingly beautiful, the snarling lion tamed on my back, the intricate designs gracefully hemming in his claws, the swirling vines of Morrighan weaving in and out with nimble elegance, spilling in a V down my back until the last delicate tendrils clung and swirled in the gentle hollow of my lower spine. The lion was honored and yet cleverly subdued.</p> <p>My throat tightened, and my eyes stung. It was a kavah I might have loved&nbsp;&#x2026; might have been proud to wear. I swallowed and imagined the prince when the vows were complete and the wedding cloak lowered, gaping with awe. <i>The lecherous toad.</i> But I gave the artisans their due.</p> <p>&#x201c;It is perfection. I thank you, and I&#x2019;ve no doubt the Kingdom of Dalbreck will from this day forward hold the artisans of Morrighan in highest esteem.&#x201d; My mother smiled at my effort, knowing that these few words from me were hard-won.</p> <p>And with that, everyone was ushered away, the remaining preparations to be shared only with my parents, and Pauline, who would assist me. My mother brought the white silk underdress from the wardrobe, a mere wisp of fabric so thin and fluid it melted across her arms. To me it was a useless formality, for it covered very little, being as transparent and helpful as the endless layers of tradition. The gown came next, the back plunging in the same V so as to frame the kavah honoring the prince&#x2019;s kingdom and displaying his bride&#x2019;s new allegiance.</p> <p>My mother tightened the laces in the hidden structure of the dress, pulling it snug so the bodice appeared to effortlessly cling to my waist even without fabric stretching across my back. It was an engineering feat as remarkable as the great bridge of Golgata, maybe more so, and I wondered if the seamstresses had cast a bit of magic into the fabric and threads. It was better to think on these details than what the short hour would bring. My mother turned me ceremoniously to face the mirror.</p> <p>Despite my resentment, I was hypnotized. It was truly the most beautiful gown I had ever seen. Stunningly elegant, the dense Quiass� lace of local lace makers was the only adornment around the dipping neckline. <i>Simplicity.</i> The lace flowed in a V down the bodice to mirror the cut of the back of the dress. I looked like someone else in it, someone older and wiser. Someone with a pure heart that held no secrets. Someone&nbsp;&#x2026; not like me.</p> <p>I walked away without comment and stared out the window, my mother&#x2019;s soft sigh following on my heels. In the far distance, I saw the lone red spire of Golgata, its single crumbling ruin all that remained of the once massive bridge that spanned the vast inlet. Soon, it too would be gone, swallowed up like the rest of the great bridge. Even the mysterious engineering magic of the Ancients couldn&#x2019;t defy the inevitable. Why should I try?</p> <p>My stomach lurched, and I shifted my gaze closer to the bottom of the hill, where wagons lumbered on the road far below the citadelle, heading toward the town square, perhaps laden with fruit, or flowers, or kegs of wine from the Morrighan vineyards. Fine carriages pulled by matching ribboned steeds dotted the lane as well.</p> <p>Maybe in one of those carriages, my oldest brother, Walther, and his young bride, Greta, sat with fingers entwined on their way to my wedding, scarcely able to break their gazes from each other. And maybe my other brothers were already at the square, flashing their smiles at young girls who drew their fancy. I remembered seeing Regan, dreamy-eyed and whispering to the coachman&#x2019;s daughter just a few days ago in a dark hallway, and Bryn dallied with a new girl each week, unable to settle on just one. Three older brothers I adored, all free to fall in love and marry anyone they chose. The girls free to choose as well. Everyone free, including Pauline, who had a beau who would return to her at month&#x2019;s end.</p> <p>&#x201c;How did you do it, Mother?&#x201d; I asked, still staring at the passing carriages below. &#x201c;How did you travel all the way from Gastineux to marry a toad you didn&#x2019;t love?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Your father is not a toad,&#x201d; my mother said sternly.</p> <p>I whirled to face her. &#x201c;A king maybe, but a toad nonetheless. Do you mean to tell me that when you married a stranger twice your age, you didn&#x2019;t think him a toad?&#x201d;</p> <p>My mother&#x2019;s gray eyes rested calmly on me. &#x201c;No, I did not. It was my destiny and my duty.&#x201d;</p> <p>A weary sigh broke from my chest. &#x201c;Because you were a First Daughter.&#x201d;</p> <p>The subject of First Daughter was one my mother always cleverly steered away from. Today, with only the two of us present and no other distractions, she couldn&#x2019;t turn away. I watched her stiffen, her chin rising in good royal form. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an honor, Arabella.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t have the gift of First Daughter. I&#x2019;m not a Siarrah. Dalbreck will soon discover I&#x2019;m not the asset they suppose me to be. This wedding is a sham.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The gift may come in time,&#x201d; she answered weakly.</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t argue this point. It was known that most First Daughters came into their gift by womanhood, and I had been a woman for four years now. I&#x2019;d shown no signs of any gift. My mother clung to false hopes. I turned away, looking out the window again.</p> <p>&#x201c;Even if it doesn&#x2019;t come,&#x201d; my mother continued, &#x201c;the wedding is no sham. This union is about far more than just one asset. The honor and privilege of a First Daughter in a royal bloodline is a gift in itself. It carries history and tradition with it. That&#x2019;s all that matters.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Why First Daughter? Can you be sure the gift isn&#x2019;t passed to a son? Or a Second Daughter?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s happened, but&nbsp;&#x2026; not to be expected. And not tradition.&#x201d;</p> <p><i>And is it tradition to lose your gift too?</i> Those unsaid words hung razor sharp between us, but even I couldn&#x2019;t wound my mother with them. My father hadn&#x2019;t consulted with her on matters of state since early in their marriage, but I had heard the stories of before, when her gift was strong and what she said mattered. That is, if any of it was even true. I wasn&#x2019;t sure anymore.</p> <p>I had little patience for such gibberish. I liked my words and reasoning simple and straightforward. And I was so tired of hearing about tradition that I was certain if the word were spoken aloud one more time, my head would explode. My mother was from another time.</p> <p>I heard her approach and felt her warm arms circle about me. My throat swelled. &#x201c;My precious daughter,&#x201d; she whispered against my ear, &#x201c;whether the gift comes or doesn&#x2019;t come is of little matter. Don&#x2019;t worry yourself so. It&#x2019;s your wedding day.&#x201d;</p> <p><i>To a toad.</i> I had caught a glimpse of the King of Dalbreck when he came to draw up the agreement&#x2014;as if I were a horse given in trade to his son. The king was as decrepit and crooked as an old crone&#x2019;s arthritic toe&#x2014;old enough to be my own father&#x2019;s father. Hunched and slow, he needed assistance up the steps to the Grand Hall. Even if the prince was a fraction of his age, he&#x2019;d still be a withered, toothless fop. The thought of him touching me, much less&#x2014;</p> <p>I shivered at the thought of bony old hands caressing my cheek or shriveled sour lips meeting mine. I kept my gaze fixed out the window, but saw nothing beyond the glass. &#x201c;Why could I not have at least inspected him first?&#x201d;</p> <p>My mother&#x2019;s arms dropped from around me. &#x201c;Inspect a prince? Our relationship with Dalbreck is already tenuous at best. You&#x2019;d have us insult their kingdom with such a request when Morrighan is hoping to create a crucial alliance?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a soldier in Father&#x2019;s army.&#x201d;</p> <p>My mother drew closer, brushing my cheek, and whispered, &#x201c;Yes, my dear. You are.&#x201d;</p> <p>A chill danced down my spine.</p> <p>She gave me a last squeeze and stepped back. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time. I&#x2019;ll go retrieve the wedding cloak from the vault,&#x201d; she said, and left.</p> <p>I crossed the room to my wardrobe and flung open the doors, sliding out the bottom drawer and lifting a green velvet pouch that held a slim jeweled dagger. It had been a gift on my sixteenth birthday from my brothers, a gift I was never allowed to use&#x2014;at least openly&#x2014;but the back of my dressing chamber door bore the gouged marks of my secret practice. I snatched a few more belongings, wrapping them in a chemise, and tied it all with ribbon to secure it.</p> <p>Pauline returned from dressing herself, and I handed her the small bundle.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take care of it,&#x201d; she said, a jumble of nerves at the last-minute preparations.

Allison and Tasuku Honjo.</b><br>For decades, scientists have puzzled over one of medicine's most confounding mysteries: Why doesn't our immune system recognize and fight cancer the way it does other diseases, like the common cold?<br>As it turns out, the answer to that question can be traced to a series of tricks that cancer has developed to turn off normal immune responses-tricks that scientists have only recently discovered and learned to defeat. The result is what many are calling cancer's "penicillin moment," a revolutionary discovery in our understanding of cancer and how to beat it.<br>In THE BREAKTHROUGH, Graeber guides readers through the revolutionary scientific research bringing immunotherapy out of the realm of the miraculous and into the forefront of twenty-first-century medical science. As advances in the fields of cancer research and the human immune system continue to fuel a therapeutic arms race among biotech and pharmaceutical research centers around the world, the next step-harnessing the wealth of new information to create modern and more effective patient therapies-is unfolding at an unprecedented pace, rapidly redefining our relationship with this all-too-human disease.<br>Groundbreaking, riveting, and expertly told, THE BREAKTHROUGH is the story of the game-changing scientific discoveries that unleash our natural ability to recognize and defeat cancer, as told through the experiences of the patients, physicians, and cancer immunotherapy researchers who are on the front lines. This is the incredible true story of the race to find a cure, a dispatch from the life-changing world of modern oncological science, and a brave new chapter in medical history.</p><p><i>"An expertly crafted and exhilarating account of life-saving ingenuity at its most dazzling.

Poirier, chairman of the board of Peacemaker Ministries, shows pastors the importance of a reconciliation ministry, gives them a theological framework for peacemaking, and provides practical tools for facilitating the peacemaking process. <br><br>Written by a pastor for pastors, this insightful book will encourage and equip seminaries and ministry leaders in their original calling-promoting a culture of peacemaking in the church.</p><p>Peacemaking: The healing alternative to conflict in the church<br><br>Every pastor faces conflict in the church, and Alfred Poirier has this loving reminder: we can run, but we can't hide.

For millennia, Tantric adepts have harnessed this force as a means of attaining the summits of the mystical life. The energies fueled by passion are used to nourish the inner flame that burns away the egotistical perception of the mind. <br> <br><i>Desire</i> explores the subtle techniques of Tantra that enable the seeker to attain the triple mastery of the breath, thought, and the natural processes of the body. Tantrics believe that the body is the temple and divinity lies at its heart. In order to arrive at profound awareness, the body needs to be perfectly tuned and working toward a state of perfect fluidity. <i>Desire</i> reveals many of the secret practices intended for this purpose that have been passed down in the major Tantric treatises such as the Vijnanabhariva Tantra and Ch'an master Chinul's treatise on the <i>Secrets of Cultivating the Mind</i>, including the important techniques of the ritual sexual observances known as <i>Maithuna</i>.</p><p>The old saw in Buddhism is that desire is the noxious weed that keeps us lurching from one unsatisfactory pleasure to the next, and that uprooting it is the only way to liberation. Daniel Odier, a scholar and teacher of tantra, turns this wisdom on its head in <i>Desire: The Tantric Path to Awakening</i>, saying that desire is the only true path to liberation. Odier objects to any religion that pretends to offer liberation in any form other than simple, personal experience. Stemming from the Tibetan master Kalu Rinpoche and the Kashmiri Shaivite yogini Lalita Devi, Odier's tantrism focuses on "micropractices," conscious withdrawal from habitual activities for just a few seconds several times a day. The crux is to attain consciousness, presence--and beyond this, there is no goal. For when there is eventually presence in every activity, the luminosity of existence pervades everything. At this point, the smallest things give pleasure. Gross desires fall away, to be replaced by spontaneous desires arising in a life of grace and joy. Odier's <i>Desire</i> is a challenge and a pleasure to all who feel constricted by ordinary religious practice. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Daniel Odier is one of France's most honored authors. He founded the Tantra/Chan Center in Paris and has taught courses on the spiritual traditions of the Far East at several American universities, including the University of California.

Contained in this set are 24 collector postcards of his most famous paintings.</p><p>Blending themes of pop culture with techniques reminiscent of the old masters, Mark Ryden has created a singular style that blurs the traditional boundaries between high and low art. His work first garnered attention in the 1990s when he ushered in a new genre of painting, "Pop Surrealism", dragging a host of followers in his wake. Ryden has trumped the initial surrealist strategies by choosing subject matter loaded with cultural connotation. Ryden&#x2019;s vocabulary ranges from cryptic to cute, treading a fine line between nostalgic clich� and disturbing archetype. Seduced by his infinitely detailed and meticulously glazed surfaces, the viewer is confronted with the juxtaposition of the childhood innocence and the mysterious recesses of the soul. A subtle disquiet inhabits his paintings; the work is achingly beautiful as it hints at darker psychic stuff beneath the surface of cultural kitsch. In Ryden's world cherubic girls rub elbows with strange and mysterious figures. Ornately carved frames lend the paintings a baroque exuberance that adds gravity to their enigmatic themes. Mark Ryden received a BFA in 1987 from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. His paintings have been exhibited in museums and galleries worldwide, including a retrospective &#x201c;Wondertoonel&#x201d; at the Frye Museum of Art in Seattle and Pasadena Museum of California Art, and in the exhibition "The Artist's Museum" at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.

She won the outstanding teacher award in her school for 1981. Her husband, S.M, &#x201c;Sam&#x201d; Bennett, Jr., is a successful insurance agent. On June 1, 1983, Mrs. Bennett visited the offices of John Parks Trowbridge, M.D., of Humble (a suburb of Houston), Texas, requesting assistance with her longstanding ill health.<br> &nbsp;<br> For a long time the woman had suffered with anorexia and bulimia. She dropped from 170 to 140 pounds before her marriage to Sam. Her menstrual flow stopped completely when food binging alternating with forced vomiting brought her weight down to 115 pounds. For six years she had failed to have any menstrual periods, a condition known as amenorrhea. In 1979 an endocrinologist declared that Mrs. Bennett&#x2019;s amenorrhea was correlated with the anorexia and bulimia. Standing five feet, two and one half inches in stocking feet, the patient now weighed just 102 pounds.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sniffling nose congestion, &#x201c;up and down&#x201d; energy levels, constant fatigue, and addictlike food cravings were additional troubles for Mrs. Bennett, according to the extensive patient history form she filled in. She also described multiple digestive complaints, including stool color changes, watery stools with a foul odor, and lower bowel gas. She invariably suffered with an upset stomach after eating greasy foods as well as abdominal pain, bloating from any food intake, increased pulse rate after meals, and a coated tongue. There were also obvious sugar-handling problems such as hunger between meals, irritability and moodiness just before meals, shaking and dizziness with delayed meals. All of this was combined with frequent melancholia, the repeated onset of the &#x201c;blues,&#x201d; and nervousness. Remarking that her &#x201c;get up and go had got up and gone,&#x201d; she also reported traditional low thyroid (hypothyroid) complaints. Further, Mrs. Bennett had joint stiffness, watery eyes, poor circulation in the hands and feet, sensitivity to cold, keyed up feelings, easy exhaustion, brown spots on the skin, and weak nails, and she commonly developed &#x201c;goosebumps.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The patient&#x2019;s litany of disorders illustrates the uncharacteristic illness patterns that Dr. Trowbridge proceeded to evaluate. After a series of clinical and laboratory examinations, Mrs. Bennett was found to have a satisfactory chemical profile. Nothing significant in her tests suggested the true source of the numerous abnormalities. Cytotoxic testing&#x2014;one method of checking for cell poisoning by environmental agents&#x2014;did reveal allergic reactions or chemical intolerances to twenty-seven different foods. Her hair mineral analysis showed a pattern typically found in people with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). She had a number of mineral deficiencies as well as receding gums. Attributing her irritable bowel symptoms to recent home stresses, she explained that she and her husband were trying desperately to meet the qualifications to adopt a baby.<br> &nbsp;<br> The doctor prescribed relief-giving medication and nutritional supplementation and advised other simple remedies for these diverse difficulties. Until he could sufficiently define her underlying problem, the true reason for all of these signs and symptoms, he was treating empirically (based on his observations).<br> &nbsp;<br> Dr. Trowbridge consulted with Mrs. Bennett bimonthly thereafter, but no spectacular improvement occurred in her condition. She retained all of the same troubles, reported that four nose bleeds had spontaneously come on at different times, and her underarm lymph glands had become swollen and tender.<br> &nbsp;<br> At her visit on December 12, 1983, Mrs. Bennett described several weeks of intense sugar cravings that had caused her to gobble down many refined carbohydrates&#x2014;candy, cake, bread&#x2014;and she was experiencing constipation that she attributed to a mostly dairy diet, including lots of ice cream. In their discussion Dr. Trowbridge drew out the critical fact that the teacher was feeling severe discomfort from the mildew in her classroom, which had accumulated as a result of tornado and hurricane flooding that had affected their area of Louisiana and Texas in the late summer and early fall of 1983. Her nasal congestion was worse than ever.<br> &nbsp;<br> With a clinical supposition that this mildew from fungal microorganisms was contributing to her problems, Dr. Trowbridge started his patient on an antifungal (anti-Candida) treatment program. When Mrs. Bennett returned for consultation three weeks later, she reported an easing of her constipation, a lessening of the sniffles, and lots more energy. She also asked to eliminate the thyroid medicine, which had been required to lessen her fatigue. Dr. Trowbridge added more antiyeast medication, Lactobacillus acidophilus powder (the friendly culture from which yogurt is made), and aged garlic extract and recommended a reduced carbohydrate diet to counteract the worsening mildew situation in which she worked.<br> &nbsp;<br> She reported gradual improvement at each bimonthly visit. By August 1984, Mrs. Bennett had experienced her first menstrual period in seven years. It lasted five days. It was a harbinger of her return to near normal health and significant because she and her husband had just learned that they did not yet qualify to adopt a baby.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the months that followed the woman reported the steady reduction of her discomforts. Her sexual desire returned strongly. Her breasts swelled at her regular menstrual cycles, just as they had done when she was in her early twenties.<br> &nbsp;<br> In October 1985, Mrs. Bennett stated that she remained happy with the treatment she had received to rid her body of various yeast-related illnesses and to restore balance to her biochemical functioning.

As the adjutant hurried to keep pace with the taller man&#x2019;s determined steps, the strident voice of the protocol droid slithered through the opening before the door resealed itself.<br><br> &#x201c;But, sir, the fitting!&#x201d;<br><br> Originally a cramped garrison base deployed from a Victory-�class Star Destroyer, Sentinel now sprawled in all directions as a result of prefabricated modules that had since been delivered or assembled on site. The heart of the facility was a warren of corridors linking one module to the next, their ceilings lost behind banks of harsh illuminators, forced-�air ducts, fire-�suppression pipes, and bundled strands of snaking wires. Everything had an improvised look, but as this was Moff Wilhuff Tarkin&#x2019;s domain, the radiantly heated walkways and walls were spotless, and the pipes and feeds were meticulously organized and labeled with alphanumerics. Overworked scrubbers purged staleness and the smell of ozone from the recycled air. The corridors were crowded not only with specialists and junior officers, but also with droids of all sizes and shapes, twittering, beeping, and chirping to one another as their optical sensors assessed the speed and momentum of Tarkin&#x2019;s forward march and propelling themselves out of harm&#x2019;s way at the last possible instant, on treads, casters, repulsors, and ungainly metal legs. Between the blare of distant alarms and the warble of announcements ordering personnel to muster stations, it was difficult enough to hear oneself think, and yet Tarkin was receiving updates through an ear bead as well as communicating continually with Sentinel&#x2019;s command center through a speck of a microphone adhered to his voice box.<br><br> He wedged the audio bead deeper into his ear as he strode through a domed module whose skylight wells revealed that the storm had struck with full force and was shaking Sentinel for all it was worth. Exiting the dome and moving against a tide of staff and droids, he right-�angled through two short stretches of corridor, doors flying open at his approach and additional personnel joining him at each juncture&#x2014;�senior officers, navy troopers, communications technicians, some of them young and shorn, most of them in uniform, and all of them human&#x2014;�so that by the time he reached the command center, the duster billowing behind him like a cape, it was as if he were leading a parade.<br><br> At Tarkin&#x2019;s request, the rectangular space was modeled after the sunken data pits found aboard Imperial-�class Star Destroyers. Filing in behind him, the staffers he had gathered along the way rushed to their duty stations, even while others already present were leaping to their feet to deliver salutes. Tarkin waved them back into their swivel chairs and positioned himself on a landing at the center of the room with a clear view of the holoimagers, sensor displays, and authenticators. Off to one side of him, Base Commander Cassel, dark-�haired and sturdy, was leaning across the primary holoprojector table, above which twitched a grainy image of antique starfighters executing strafing runs across Rampart&#x2019;s gleaming surface, while the marshaling station&#x2019;s batteries responded with green pulses of laser energy. In a separate holovid even more corrupted than the first, insect-�winged Geonosian laborers could be seen scrambling for cover in one of the station&#x2019;s starfighter hangars. A distorted voice was crackling through the command center&#x2019;s wall-�mounted speaker array.<br><br> &#x201c;Our shields are already down to forty percent, Sentinel . . . jamming our transmiss . . .lost communication with the Brentaal. �Request immediate . . . Sentinel. Again: request immediate reinforcement.&#x201d;<br><br> A skeptical frown formed on Tarkin&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;A sneak attack? Impossible.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Rampart reports that the attack ship transmitted a valid HoloNet code on entering the system,&#x201d; Cassel said. &#x201c;Rampart, can you eavesdrop on the comm chatter of those starfighters?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Negative, Sentinel,&#x201d; the reply came a long moment later. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re jamming our signals net.&#x201d;<br><br> Peering over his shoulder at Tarkin, Cassel made as if to cede his position, but Tarkin motioned for him to stay where he was. &#x201c;Can the image be stabilized?&#x201d; he asked the specialist at the holoprojector controls.<br><br> &#x201c;Sorry, sir,&#x201d; the specialist said. &#x201c;Increasing the gain only makes matters worse. The transmission appears to be corrupted at the far end. I haven&#x2019;t been able to establish if Rampart initiated countermeasures.&#x201d;<br><br> Tarkin glanced around the room. &#x201c;And on our end?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The HoloNet relay station is best possible,&#x201d; the specialist at the comm board said.<br><br> &#x201c;It is raining, sir,&#x201d; a different spec added, eliciting a chorus of good-�natured laughter from others seated nearby. Even Tarkin grinned, though fleetingly.<br><br> &#x201c;Who are we speaking with?&#x201d; he asked Cassel.<br><br> &#x201c;A Lieutenant Thon,&#x201d; the commander said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been on station for only three months, but he&#x2019;s following protocol and transmitting on priority encryption.&#x201d;<br><br> Tarkin clasped his hands behind his back beneath the duster and glanced at the specialist seated at the authenticator. &#x201c;Does the effectives roster contain an image of our Lieutenant Thon?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;On screen, sir,&#x201d; the staffer said, flicking a joystick and indicating one of the displays.<br><br> Tarkin shifted his gaze. A sandy-�haired human with protruding ears, Thon was as untried as he sounded. Fresh from one of the academies, Tarkin thought. He stepped down from the platform and moved to the holoprojector table to study the strafing starfighters more closely. Bars of corruption elevatored through the stuttering holovid. Rampart&#x2019;s shields were nullifying most of the aggressors&#x2019; energy beams, but all too frequently a disabling run would succeed and white-�hot explosions would erupt in one of the depot&#x2019;s deep-�space docks.<br><br> &#x201c;Those are Tikiars and Headhunters,&#x201d; Tarkin said in surprise.<br><br> &#x201c;Modified,&#x201d; Cassel said. &#x201c;Basic hyperdrives and upgraded weaponry.&#x201d;<br><br> Tarkin squinted at the holo. &#x201c;The fuselages bear markings.&#x201d; He turned in the direction of the spec closest to the authenticator station. &#x201c;Run the markings through the database. Let&#x2019;s see if we can&#x2019;t determine whom we&#x2019;re dealing with.&#x201d;<br><br> Tarkin turned back to Cassel. &#x201c;Did they arrive on their own, or launch from the attack ship?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Delivered,&#x201d; the commander said.<br><br> Without turning around Tarkin said: &#x201c;Has this Thon provided holovid or coordinates for the vessel that brought the starfighters?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Holovid, sir,&#x201d; someone said, &#x201c;but we only got a quick look at it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Replay the transmission,&#x201d; Tarkin said.<br><br> A separate holotable projected a blurry, blue-�tinted image of a fantailed capital ship with a spherical control module located amidships. The downsloping curved bow and smooth hull gave it the look of a deep-�sea behemoth. Tarkin circled the table, appraising the hologram.<br><br> &#x201c;What is this thing?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Begged and borrowed, sir,&#x201d; someone reported. &#x201c;Separatist-�era engineering more than anything else. The central sphere resembles one of the old Trade Federation droid control computers, and the entire forward portion might&#x2019;ve come from a Commerce Guild destroyer. Front-�facing sensor array tower. IFF&#x2019;s highlighting modules consistent with CIS Providence-�, Recusant-�, and Munificent-�class warships.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Pirates?&#x201d; Cassel ventured. &#x201c;Privateers?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Have they issued any demands?&#x201d; Tarkin asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Nothing yet.&#x201d; Cassel waited a beat. &#x201c;Insurgents?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No data on the starfighter fuselage markings, sir,&#x201d; someone said.<br><br> Tarkin touched his jaw but said nothing. As he continued to circle the hologram, a flare of wavy corruption in the lower left portion captured his attention. &#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; he said, standing tall. &#x201c;At the lower&#x2014;� There it is again.&#x201d; He counted quietly to himself; at the count of ten he fixed his gaze on the same area of the hologram. &#x201c;And again!&#x201d; He swung to the specialist. &#x201c;Replay the recording at half speed.&#x201d;<br><br> Tarkin kept his eyes on the lower left quadrant as the holovid restarted and began a new count. &#x201c;Now!&#x201d; he said, in advance of every instance of corruption. &#x201c;Now!&#x201d;<br><br> Chairs throughout the room swiveled. &#x201c;Encryption noise?&#x201d; someone suggested.<br><br> &#x201c;Ionization effect,&#x201d; another said.<br><br> Tarkin held up a hand to silence the speculations. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t a guessing game, ladies and gentlemen.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Interval corruption of some sort,&#x201d; Cassel said.<br><br> &#x201c;Of some sort indeed.&#x201d; Tarkin watched silently as the prerecorded holovid recycled for a third time, then he moved to the communications station. &#x201c;Instruct Lieutenant Thon to show himself,&#x201d; he said to the seated spec.<br><br> &#x201c;Sir?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Tell him to train a cam on himself.&#x201d;</p><h2>Shelley: Poems (Everyman&#39;s Library Pocket Poets Series)</h2><p>Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822) was perhaps the most intellectually adventurous of the great Romantic poets. &nbsp;A classicist, a headlong visionary, a social radical, and a poet of serene artistry with a lyric touch second to none, Shelley personified the richly various&#x2014;and contradictory&#x2014;energies of his time.

The author first walks clinicians and readers through a critique of Western culture and the conservative Christian Church, and their effects on intimate partnerships and sexual lives. The book provides clinicians a way to understand the faulty sexual ethic of the early church, while revealing the hidden mystical sex and body positive understanding of sexuality of the Hebrew people. The book also includes chapters on strategies for a new sexual ethic, on clinical steps to heal religious sexual shame, and on specific sex therapy interventions clinicians can use directly in their practice. Finally, it offers a four step model for healing religious sexual shame and actual touch and non-touch exercises to bring healing and intimacy into a person's life.</p></p><p><p><strong>Tina Schermer Sellers, PhD</strong>, is a licensed marriage and family therapist and certified sex therapist, as well as a professor of sexuality and medical family therapy in the graduate Family Therapy Department at Seattle Pacific University.</p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Tina Schermer Sellers&#x2019; provocative book addresses the sex-negative doctrine in the conservative Christian church that instills in many people deep shame about their body and discomfort with the opposite sex, making them ill-prepared for marriage.

The police represent the most direct means by which the state imposes its will on the citizenry. They are armed, trained, and authorized to use force. Like the possibility of arrest, the threat of violence is implicit in every police encounter. Violence, as well as the law, is what they represent.</i></p><p>Using media reports alone, the Cato Institute's last annual study listed nearly seven thousand victims of police "misconduct" in the United States. But such stories of police brutality only scratch the surface of a national epidemic. Every year, tens of thousands are framed, blackmailed, beaten, sexually assaulted, or killed by cops. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on civil judgments and settlements annually. Individual lives, families, and communities are destroyed.</p><p>In this extensively revised and updated edition of his seminal study of policing in the United States, Kristian Williams shows that police brutality isn't an anomaly, but is built into the very meaning of law enforcement in the United States. From antebellum slave patrols to today's unarmed youth being gunned down in the streets, "peace keepers" have always used force to shape behavior, repress dissent, and defend the powerful. <i>Our Enemies in Blue</i> is a well-researched page-turner that both makes historical sense of this legalized social pathology and maps out possible alternatives.</p><p><b>Kristian Williams</b> is the author of several books, including <i>American Methods: Torture and the Logic of Domination</i>. He co-edited <i>Life During Wartime: Resisting Counterinsurgency</i>, and lives in Portland, Oregon.</p></p><p>Kristian Williams is the author of <i>American Methods: Torture and the Logic of Domination</i>, <i>Hurt: Notes on Torture in a Modern Democracy</i>, and <i>Fire the Cops!</i> He was one of the editors of the collection <i>Life During Wartime: Resisting Counterinsurgency</i>, and is a contributing editor at the movement security web journal, DCSC.ws. He has written about policing and state violence for <i>Clamor</i>, <i>Counterpunch</i>, <i>New Politics</i>, <i>In These Times</i>, and <i>Toward Freedom</i>. He lives in Portland, Oregon.Sweeping generalizations and little nuance make self-described anarchist Williams's first book likely to appeal only to a preselected readership who will not be put off by the title and the oversimplified theme that police officers are inherently aggressive, racist and brutal tools of the powers that be. Williams, who has written for <i>Dissent</i> and the <i>Progressive,</i> traces the development of the American police from colonial times and Southern efforts to keep slaves in check. He's strongest in delineating the unintended consequences of well-intentioned efforts to reduce police corruption and brutality, but barely a page goes by without the voicing of extremist views (e.g., a New York PBA rally that became a riot against then-mayor David Dinkins, followed by the election of the police-friendly Rudolph Giuliani, is called a "municipal-level coup"). While the litany of police misdeeds&#x2014;ranging from collusion with the Klan to the shooting of unarmed Amadou Diallo&#x2014;makes plain that there has always been unjustified behavior by police, it doesn't prove his argument that nothing can be done to reform the force. His alternate proposal&#x2014;replacing a government force with a voluntary community patrol&#x2014;will strike many as na�ve in a post-9/11 world, and too rigid when he dismisses, as a form of co-optation, community policing, which has enabled officers to rely less on force. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(The Pistis Sophia) <br><br>The Apostles wrote down what Jesus taught them during those eleven years, resulting in "The Pistis Sophia," the most important Gnostic scripture. Includes an extensive commentary by Samael Aun Weor. "The Pistis Sophia" is a sophisticated and deeply mystical teaching given by Jesus about the suffering of Sophia as she attempts to ascend to the highest spiritual truth. This scripture is remarkable for its profound mysticism, its clear rebuke of unethical behavior, and its perspective on the spiritual role of women. Having read this text, it becomes very clear why the established religious powers attempted to obliterate the Gnostics, but failed. Study of this teaching also inspires a re-evaluation of how the Christian Gospels have been interpreted for centuries.<br><br>About this scripture, the commentary author Samael Aun Weor said, ""The Hebrew Bible clearly connotes the Word of the Eternal One. However, we, the Gnostics, also have our very special Bible. I want to emphatically declare that this is The Pistis Sophia, whose original is in Coptic. It was found underground in Egypt, the land of the Pharaohs. The Pistis Sophia contains all the words of the adorable Savior of the world. It was written by the Apostles. Thus, all the Esoteric-Christic instructions that Jesus Christ gave to his disciples on the Mount of the Olives and other holy places is written within this book. This book had been conserved in secret for many centuries. In this book, the Adorable One left an extraordinary, formidable body of doctrine."</p><p>The name Samael Aun Weor is Hebrew and is pronounced sam-ayel on vay-ohr. Samael Aun Weor wrote over sixty books, gave thousands of lectures, and formed the worldwide Gnostic Movement, whose members number in the millions. And yet, in spite of his wisdom and generosity towards mankind, he said: &#34;Do not follow me. I am just a signpost. Reach your own Self-realization.&#34; His lifelong mission was to deliver to humanity the total and exact science to develop the complete human being, that mysterious and ancient wisdom long hidden in the bosom of every great religion.The Hebrew Bible clearly connotes the word of the Eternal One. However, we, the Gnostics, also have our very special Bible. I want to emphatically declare that this is The Pistis Sophia, whose original is in Coptic. It was found underground in Egypt, the land of the Pharaohs.<br><br>The Pistis Sophia contains all the words of the adorable Savior of the world. It was written by the Apostles. Thus, all the esoteric Christic instructions that Jesus Christ gave to his disciples on the Mount of Olives and other holy places is written within this book. This book had been conserved in secret for many centuries. In this book, the Adorable One left an extraordinary, formidable body of doctrine.<br><br>Samael Aun Weor, who is my real Being within me-that is to say, my profound real inner Being-has commented on each paragraph of the Nazarene's doctrine. My inner God Samael unveiled each paragraph, in order to explain it correctly. We are delivering this work precisely in these despairing moments. Thus, this is how we will be able to give to humanity the unveiled and explained Pistis Sophia: the body of doctrine of the adorable Savior of the world, Jesus Christ.<br><br>Humanity will undoubtedly be surprised because the doctrine of the Nazarene is formidable. It is hidden wisdom in the most transcendental sense of the word. Therefore, all Gnostics must study The Pistis Sophia. This book must always be on the Gnostic altars. This book reveals to us the word of the Master, of the Lord, of Christ. We, the Gnostics, must venerate His work.<br><br>I do not want to underestimate the Hebrew Bible, since it is an extraordinary and marvellous book. However, we, the Gnostics, have our own specific book: The Gnostic Bible-The Pistis Sophia, which is the written word of Christ. <br><br>Obviously all religions, schools and beliefs will be shaken to their very roots, because the word of the Adorable One is extraordinary.</p><h2>How To Blog For Profit: Without Selling Your Soul</h2><p><b>Do you want to earn a living doing what you love?</b><br><br>Whether you have been blogging for years or just a few weeks, How to Blog For Profit (Without Selling Your Soul) offers solid advice and practical action plans for creating an authentic, successful, and profitable blog.<br><br>With wit, wisdom, and the insight of someone who&#x2019;s been there, Ruth Soukup shares how she grew her own blog, Living Well Spending Less, to over one million monthly visitors, earns a full time income, and still is able to write about the things she truly cares about.<br><br><b>In this expanded 2nd Edition of How to Blog for Profit you will:</b><br><br>�Stop comparing your blog to those around you and instead learn to leverage your own unique assets.<br>�Discover the secrets to creating amazing, compelling blog content that brings readers back again and again.<br>�Learn how to increase your blog traffic and build solid platform through field-tested strategies.�Develop a solid social media strategy for capturing viral growth through Pinterest and Facebook.<br>�Dramatically boost your revenue through diversified income streams.<br>�Improve your productivity, learning to work smarter not harder, and take concrete steps to transform your blog into a business.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>How to Blog for Profit</i>:</b><br><br>&#x201c;How to Blog for Profit is hands down the best blogging book I&#x2019;ve ever read.

But, worse still, they refused to halt food exports from the starving country.</p><p>Emigration quickened as many were evicted, and many more fled from a wasted land. They worked the waterfronts and coal mine of America and the railways and building sites of England. But hunger still stalked them.</p><p><em>Cold is the Dawn</em>&nbsp;follows these men and women and their bitter fight for survival in Ireland, England and America.</p></p><p>Charles Egan was born in Nottingham, England, of Irish parents. When he was five, the family returned to Ireland, as his father had been appointed Resident Medical Superintendent of St. Luke&#39;s, a psychiatric hospital in Clonmel, in County Tipperary. Every summer they visited his father&#39;s family&#39;s farm, outside Kiltimagh in County Mayo for a month, where his grandmother and uncles spent many evenings, talking about family and local history. The family subsequently moved to County Wicklow, where he initially attended the De La Salle Brothers School in Wicklow town. He then went to the Jesuits&#39; Clongowes Wood College (James Joyce&#39;s alma mater), and subsequently studied Commerce in University College Dublin, graduating in 1973. After an initial career in the private sector, including Marubeni Dublin, (where he met his future wife, Carmel), he joined the Industrial Development Authority (IDA) in Dublin. After a few years, the desire to be his own boss, led him to resign and set up his own business, which ran for 30 years.

"One of the great survival stories of all time."&#x2015;<em>Library Journal</em></strong></p> Frank A. Worsley was the captain of the H.M.S. <em>Endurance</em>, the ship used by the legendary explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton in his 1914-16 expedition to the Antarctic. On its way to the Antarctic continent the <em>Endurance</em> became trapped and then crushed by ice, and the ship's party of twenty-eight drifted on an ice floe for five months. Finally reaching an uninhabited island, Shackleton, Worsley, and four others sailed eight hundred miles in a small boat to the island of South Georgia, an astounding feat of navigation and courage. All hands survived this ill-fated expedition; as Worsley writes, "By self-sacrifice and throwing his own life into the balance, [Shackleton] saved every one of his men . . . although at times it had looked unlikely that one could be saved." "This remarkable book . . . shows [Shackleton] both luckless and lucky, and supremely cool and courageous throughout. Worsley writes without heroics . . . but makes us feel to the marrow the conditions that the party endured before all hands were rescued."&#x2015;<em>The New Yorker</em>&nbsp; "Worsley's account of that journey is a breath-taking story of courage, skill and determination under the most appalling conditions."&#x2015;Sir Edmund Hillary Illustrations</p><p>A native New Zealander, Frank A. Worsley served as a reserve officer in the Royal Navy before becoming captain of the Endurance. He commanded two ships in World War I, for which he was decorated, sailed with Shackleton again in 1921, and in 1925 was the joint leader of the British Arctic Exploration. Worsley died in 1943."The Weddell Sea might be described as the Antarctic extension of the South Atlantic Ocean. Near the southern extreme of the Weddell Sea in 77� south latitude Shackleton's ship Endurance, under my command, was beset in heavy pack ice. The temperature in February fell to 53� of frost - an unusually cold snap for the southern summer of 1914-15. <p>"The pack ice froze into a solid mass. We were unable to free the ship and she drifted northwest, 1,000 miles during the summer, autumn, and winter. The Endurance was crushed, and sank in 69� S. </p><p>"Our party of twenty-eight - eleven scientists and seventeen seamen - camped on the floes in lightweight tents through which the sun and moon shone and the blizzards chilled us. Our main food supply consisted of seals and penguins. So the ice, with its human freight, crept northwards - 600 miles in five months." </p><p>These are the dramatic opening words of Frank Worsley's gripping adventure story, hardly hinted at by his book's unassuming title, Shackleton's Boat Journey. Worsley was the captain of the Endurance, and the matter-of-fact tone that pervades this book serves to heighten rather than diminish the astounding accomplishments of Ernest Shackleton and his crew, who were attempting an Antarctic Expedition. </p><p>When the Endurance became trapped, the task of the expedition changed from one of exploration to one of survival. Manning the three lifeboats, the crew attempted to reach land, but their way was blocked by the same sort of ice that had just crushed the Endurance. They were forced to set up camp on giant ice floes, and remained drifting for five months. (Worsley charted the drift, and if they moved toward Elephant Island, he was praised, if they did not, he was cursed.) They faced the cold, killer whales, and despair, but the greatest danger was that of losing a man in the water: </p><p>"The nor'west swell rolled our ice floe to and fro, rocking us gently to sleep. Slowly the floe swung round until it was end on to the swell. The watchmen, discussing the respective merits of seal brains and livers, ignored this challenge of the swell. At 11 P.M. a larger undulation rolled beneath, lifting the floe and cracking it across under the seamen's tent. We heard a shout, and rushing out found their tent was tearing in halves - one half on our side and half on the other side of the crack." </p><p>In spite of the darkness, Sir Ernest, by some instinct, knew the right spot to go to. He found Holness - like a full-grown Moses - in his bag in the sea. Sir Ernest leaned over, seized the bag and, with one mighty effort, hove man and bag up on to the ice. Next second the halves of the floe swung together in the hollow of the swell with a thousand-ton blow. </p><p>The first part of Worsley's book chronicles the final push to the nearest land, Elephant Island, situated in the Antarctic Archipelago that reaches out into the South Sea. Shackleton then made the decision to take five men with him in one of the boats and try for South Georgia Island, a journey of over 800 miles of open sea. Worsley was chosen for his navigational skills. The latter part of the book describes their sixteen days at sea and arrival at the uninhabited side of the island. Shackleton, Worsley and Crean were forced to make a further push inland over dangerous mountainous terrain in order to reach help. </p><p>What enabled the men to persevere? Not just the incredible courage, humor, and dedication to one another that they displayed, but also an innate sense of how decent men behave. To get the entire picture of Worsley's character, however, you have to read Shackleton's account of the adventure in South (available from The Narrative Press); Worsley is too modest to put himself forward. This is an exceptional story.</p></p><h2>Egg: A Culinary Exploration of the World&#39;s Most Versatile Ingredient</h2><p><b>In this innovative cookbook, James Beard award-winning author Michael Ruhlman explains why the egg is the key to the craft of cooking.</b><br> For culinary visionary Michael Ruhlman, the question is not whether the chicken or the egg came first, it's how anything could be accomplished in the kitchen without the magic of the common egg. He starts with perfect poached and scrambled eggs and builds up to brioche and Italian meringue. Along the way readers learn to make their own mayonnaise, pasta, custards, quiches, cakes, and other preparations that rely fundamentally on the hidden powers of the egg.<br> <br>A unique framework for the book is provided in Ruhlman's egg flowchart, which starts with the whole egg at the top and branches out to describe its many uses and preparations -- boiled, pressure-cooked, poached, fried, coddled, separated, worked into batters and doughs, and more. A removable illustrated flowchart is included with the book.<br> <br>Nearly 100 recipes are grouped by technique and range from simple (Egg Salad with Tarragon and Chives) to sophisticated (nougat). Dozens of step-by-step photographs guide the home cook through this remarkable culinary journey. <br></p><p>Michael Ruhlman started writing about the lives of chefs 20 years ago, and he soon found an interest in becoming a chef himself. After his success with the narrative books <i>The Making of a Chef, The Soul of a Chef </i>and <i>The Reach of a Chef, </i>he has more recently taken his own skills in cooking to write innovative and successful food reference books including <i>Ratio</i>, <i>The Elements of Cooking</i>, and <i>Charcuterie</i>. Ruhlman has also appeared on food television numerous times, notably as a judge on<i> Iron Chef</i> and as a featured guest on Anthony Bourdain's <i>No Reservations</i>.

Until now, copies on the antiquarian book circuit sold for many hundreds of dollars. It is a crucial book for understanding both Mortensen&#x2019;s philosophy and his use of psychology in the making of his pictures. To illustrate the text Mortensen includes an amazing gallery of his best-known and most challenging images with explanations, by him, of what makes those photographs so compelling.<br><br>The reprint of <i>The Command to Look</i> also contains two new major essays that assess the significance and impact of the original book. An introduction by Mortensen biographer Larry Lytle explores Mortensen&#x2019;s use of Jungian psychology and also discusses new advances in neural psychology that confirm Mortensen&#x2019;s methods of controlling the viewer&#x2019;s eye. The second essay, by historian Michael Moynihan (author of <i>Lords of Chaos</i>), details a strange and unexpected reception of the book: how this small volume on photographic methods played a role in the creation of the modern Church of Satan and Anton LaVey&#x2019;s theories about Satanic Magic.<br></p><p><b>William Mortensen</b>was an American artist and photographer, born in 1897 and who died in 1965. He was part of a group of photographers in the first part of the twentieth century called the Pictorialists, known for their romantic subject matter and alternative photographic processes. Mortensen didn&#x2019;t fit easily into that group, however. His imagery was highly manipulated and not particularly romantic instead he created compositions exploring themes of the grotesque and the erotic.<br><br>From the late 1920s until the 1940s, Mortensen was one of the best-known and most successful photographers in the United States. He had begun his artistic life as a painter and etcher and carried that training over to his photographic work, which he began in the mid 1920s. He was known for his outr� subject matter that had an unusual look it is difficult to tell, at first glance, if his images are etchings, drawings, or photographs. This work made him well regarded by many but reviled by a group of photographers called the f.64 group, also known as straight photographers.&#x201d; This group consisted, in part, of Ansel Adams, and Edward Weston.<br><br>Mortensen, together with his coauthor George Dunham, published 9 books and approximately 100 articles on his concepts and processes.

Mortensen had arrived in Laguna Beach in 1931 and opened the William Mortensen School of Photography. Dunham began posing for Mortensen in 1932, which yielded one of Mortensen&#x2019;s most well known photographs, Human Relations 1932.

The battle for Stalingrad became the focus of Hitler and Stalin&#39;s determination to win the gruesome, vicious war on the eastern front. The citizens of Stalingrad endured unimaginable hardship; the battle, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting in each room of each building, was brutally destructive to both armies. But the eventual victory of the Red Army, and the failure of Hitler&#39;s Operation Barbarossa, was the first defeat of Hitler&#39;s territorial ambitions in Europe, and the start of his decline. An extraordinary story of tactical genius, civilian bravery, obsession, carnage and the nature of war itself, Stalingrad will act as a testament to the vital role of the soviet war effort.</p><p>Hitler made two fundamental and crippling mistakes during the Second World War: The first was his whimsical belief that the United Kingdom would eventually become his ally, which delayed his decision to launch a major invasion of Britain, whose army was unprepared for the force of blitzkrieg warfare. The second was the ill-conceived Operation Barbarossa--an invasion of Russia that was supposed to take the German army to the gates of Moscow. Antony Beevor's thoughtfully researched compendium recalls this epic struggle for Stalingrad. No one, least of all the Germans, could foretell the deep well of Soviet resolve that would become the foundation of the Red Army; Russia, the Germans believed, would fall as swiftly as France and Poland. The ill-prepared Nazi forces were trapped in a bloody war of attrition against the Russian behemoth, which held them in the pit of Stalingrad for nearly two years. Beevor points out that the Russians were by no means ready for the war either, making their stand even more remarkable; Soviet intelligence spent as much time spying on its own forces--in fear of desertion, treachery, and incompetence--as they did on the Nazis. Due attention is also given to the points of view of the soldiers and generals of both forces, from the sickening battles to life in the gulags.<p> Many believe Stalingrad to be the turning point of the war. The Nazi war machine proved to be fallible as it spread itself too thin for a cause that was born more from arrogance than practicality. The Germans never recovered, and its weakened defenses were no match for the Allied invasion of 1944. We know little of what took place in Stalingrad or its overall significance, leading Beevor to humbly admit that "[t]he Battle of Stalingrad remains such an ideologically charged and symbolically important subject that the last word will not be heard for many years." This is true. But this gripping account should become the standard work against which all others should measure themselves. <i>--Jeremy Storey</i></p>Antony Beevor is the author of Crete: The Battle and the Resistance (Runciman Prize), Stalingrad (Samuel Johnson Prize, Wolfson Prize for History and Hawthornden Prize), Berlin: The Downfall, The Battle for Spain (Premio La Vanguardia), D-Day: The Battle for Normandy (Prix Henry Malherbe and the RUSI Westminster Medal), The Second World War, and Ardennes 1944 (Prix Medicis shortlist).

The descendants of Scotsmen who had colonized the Irish Kingdom of Ulster, they lived for several generations on Irish soil before heading across the Atlantic and the backwoods of America. They founded communities in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia and the Yadkin River valley of western North Carolina, eventually crossing the Cumberland Gap for the Kentucky frontier. For those Scots-Irish immigrants, life was a test of hardiness, hardship, and endurance, but frontier families also managed time for horseracing, gambling, and socializing - despite their strict Presbyterian ways. They founded churches and helped mold the governments of the new country. Scots and Scotch Irish offers a view of that time and place, along with thousands of names of those early settlers, drawn from church records, military rolls, deeds, court records, and newspapers of the time, all listed alphabetically in a series of appendices by source.</p><p></p><h2>Building the Benedict Option: A Guide to Gathering Two or Three Together in His Name</h2><p><i>Building the Benedict Option </i>is a combination spiritual memoir and practical handbook for Christians who want to build communities of prayer, socialization, and evangelization in the places where they live and work.<br> Beginning when the author was a new convert, she desired more communal prayer and fellowship than weekly Mass could provide.

The adjectives used to describe his writing &#x2014; and character &#x2014; tend to have a rather uncomplimentary ring: "venomous," "vindictive," "paranoid," "rancorous," "malevolent"; yet few would deny his brilliance of intellect and style. About half of his fiction output consisted of stories of horror and the supernatural, a genre which appealed to his psychic constitution and may have reflected a deep inner torment.<br>This volume contains 24 of Bierce's best tales of the unknown. Morbid, cynical, eerie, they take you to a twilight region of flesh and spirit &#x2014; and into the darkest recesses of the human mind. These are unusual constructions of terror and grim irony, reminiscent of Poe, the Gothic novel, and the Romantic short story, but having the unmistakable individual stamp of a man who knew first-hand something of the fears and specters which haunt men.<br>In this volume you will come across a number of old favorites: "An Inhabitant of Carcosa," "The Eyes of the Panther," "The Death of Halpin Frayser," "An Adventure at Brownville," and such classics as "The Middle Toe of the Right Foot," "The Damned Thing," and "Moonlit Road," a minor masterpiece in which events of the story are told from three different points of view, including that of the victim as spoken through a medium. You will also find some less familiar, but equally fascinating stories and pieces not available elsewhere, including "Visions of the Night," in which Bierce gives us a rationale for his "reverse holiness" and the surrealistic morality that permeates these writings. Bierce's characters &#x2014; possessed poets, shabby aristocrats, grimy professional men, revived corpses, haunted malefactors &#x2014; live in a spare, perverse world. Patricide, the revenge of the dead, inexplicable disappearances, dreadful ironies, hypnotism and second sight, and the like, form much of the substance of these unsettling tales.</p><p>Journalist, short story writer, and satirist Ambrose Bierce (1842-1914) was equally adept in a variety of genres, from ghost stories to poetry to political commentary. Bierce&#39;s fiction is particularly distinguished by its realistic depictions of the author&#39;s Civil War experiences.</p><h2>The Barrytown Trilogy: The Commitments; The Snapper; The Van</h2><p><b>A one-volume edition of the celebrated trio of novels about the Rabbitte family, from the Booker Prize-winning author o</b><i><b>f <i>Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha<br></i></b></i><b><br>Look for Roddy Doyle&#x2019;s new novel,&nbsp;<i>Smile</i>, coming in October of 2017</b><i><br><br>The Barrytown Trilogy</i> gathers Roddy&#x2019;s Doyle&#x2019;s first three novels into one volume:&nbsp;<i>The Commitments</i>, one of the funniest rock&#x2019;n&#x2019;roll novels ever written, about a group of aspiring musicians on a mission to bring soul to Dublin; <i>The Snapper</i>, about the progression of twenty-year-old Sharon Rabbitte&#x2019;s pregnancy on her family; and <i>The Van</i>, a finalist for the Booker Prize, a tender and hilarious tale of male friendship, midlife crisis, and family life, set during the heady days of Ireland&#x2019;s brief, euphoric triumphs in the 1990 World Cup.</p><p>Roddy Doyle is an internationally bestselling writer.

But as Serge and his burnout buddy Coleman go storm-chasing, bodies begin turning up at a disturbing rate, even by Florida standards. It looks like a serial killer is on the loose&#x2014;<em>another</em> serial killer&#x2014;which highly offends Serge's moral sensibilities.

Storms, a serious whack-job serial killer, and his supremely stoned sidekick, Coleman, are on the road again, this time chasing hurricanes in Florida. Oliver Wymans performance offers up a rollicking good time for fans of this dynamic duo. Theres a serial killer on the loose whos getting all the headlines, and Serge is outraged by comparisons to his work. Serge has scruples, after all. He only kills those who need killing, like the boor who wont turn down his car stereo or the ghoul selling bags of ice to hurricane victims. Wymans performance provides laugh-out-loud moments, but be warned: Dorseys offbeat humor may offend those with delicate sensibilities. S.J.H.

With an small but powerful international membership hand-picked by an executive committee, Commissioners asserted undue influence over America, Japan and Europe. In 1976, Trilateral members James Earl Carter and Walter Mondale were elected to head the Executive Branch in the U.S., thus starting a 40 year hegemony over the greatest economic nation on earth. American influence and position was used to reform international trade, promote globalization and interdependence among nations. European Trilateral members were then instrumental in using the United Nations to create a doctrine of Sustainable Development and Green Economy: See Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation (Wood, 2015) for details. Originally written in 1979-1980, Trilaterals Over Washington quickly became a best-seller and over the course of about two years, sold over 75,000 copies internationally. The books were very well received for excellent scholarship and original research, and even became a frequently-used textbook in political science classes at many colleges in U.S. universities. The co-author, Professor Antony C. Sutton, passed in 2002 having authored 24 books during a distinguished academic career that included UCLA and the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.</p><p></p><h2>God&#39;s Weapons of War: Arming the Church to Destroy the Kingdom of Darkness</h2><p>For years, we have learned principles of individual spiritual warfare. Yet as the end times are upon us, the forces of darkness are intensifying their attacks around the world. For this next season, says renowned prophetic leader Dr. Bill Hamon, we as the church must up the ante and learn to fight on a higher level than we ever have, in corporate spiritual warfare.<br> <br>With wisdom, urgency, and keen prophetic insight, Hamon lays the biblical foundation for this final level of warfare and shows how we, as the church, can prepare to work in unity to become the army of the Lord. He lays out the weapons available to us in this new battle front and reveals a plan for destroying the works of the devil and advancing God's kingdom on earth. Now is the time to rise up, fight back together, and secure the ultimate victory in Christ.</p><p><b>God wants His Kingdom established here on earth. To do so, He needs an army.<br></b><br>Speaking with the keen insight of a frontline prophet, Dr. Bill Hamon issues a call to arms for the Church. As he outlines the challenges facing God's people in these last days, Dr. Hamon explains that the fight is intensifying for every warrior. The time has come for believers to multiply our effectiveness through corporate spiritual warfare as we co-labor with Christ to&nbsp;destroy the works of the devil.<br><br>To help you stand with God's vast and mighty end-time army, Dr. Hamon answers questions such as:<br><br>� How do I fight alongside other believers?<br><br>� Do corporate prophetic acts, such as shouting, work?<br><br>� Can believers really access an "open heaven"?<br><br>� And much more!<br><br>Prophetic Scriptures concerning God's end-time&nbsp;army are being fulfilled around the globe. We will soon see more manifestations of His power and glory than ever recorded in Church history. But this is a battle we must fight together, says Dr. Hamon.&nbsp;Take your place with other believers in the final purposes for God's Church!<br><br><b>"This book will challenge and encourage you to know what God is saying to the Church today.

The first to go is the Duke of Gloucester, Lord Protector of England and the most powerful man in the kingdom, who is murdered after his wife goes into exile.<br> <br>Next to meet a bad end is the Duke of Suffolk, the queen&#x2019;s lover, who rules England through her. After Suffolk conspires with the cardinal of Winchester to kill Gloucester, he is banished and assassinated. The cardinal dies raving of his own guilt.<br> <br>Ultimately, the king&#x2019;s weakness lies behind these events. Preferring spiritual contemplation, he has left others to contend for power. Now his liberty is at risk as Jack Cade, and then the Duke of York, rise against him. The play leaves us in suspense about Henry&#x2019;s fate by ending with the start of the Wars of the Roses&#x2014;a conflict setting the white rose of the Duke of York against the red rose of King Henry, of the House of Lancaster.<br> <br>The authoritative edition of <i>Henry VI, Part 2</i> from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:<br> <br> -Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play<br> -Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play<br> -Scene-by-scene plot summaries<br> -A key to the play&#x2019;s famous lines and phrases<br> -An introduction to reading Shakespeare&#x2019;s language<br> -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play<br> -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library&#x2019;s vast holdings of rare books<br> -An annotated guide to further reading<br> <br>Essay by Nina Levine<br> <br>The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world&#x2019;s largest collection of Shakespeare&#x2019;s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. The couple had three children&#x2014;an older daughter Susanna and twins, Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet, Shakespeare&#x2019;s only son, died in childhood. The bulk of Shakespeare&#x2019;s working life was spent in the theater world of London, where he established himself professionally by the early 1590s. He enjoyed success not only as a playwright and poet, but also as an actor and shareholder in an acting company. Although some think that sometime between 1610 and 1613 Shakespeare retired from the theater and returned home to Stratford, where he died in 1616, others believe that he may have continued to work in London until close to his death.<br><br>Barbara A.

They face their darkest childhood fears and new imaginary threats, like trolls masquerading as boulders and child-eating tree trunks.<br>A harrowing story of those days in the woods, of illness, poisoning, and accidents; of a love triangle among tots; a pint-sized hero; and a child on a murderous rampage that comes to a grisly end. Part fairy tale, part horror story, this macabre fable takes us through the minds of all the members of this doomed part, murderers and murdered alike.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Laws of the Skies</i> takes its title from a fable told within its pages, about a mouse who learns to fly, becoming a bat -- and who is subsequently attacked and blinded by vengeful birds. That description suggests a sharp turn from whimsy to menace, and it serves as a model for the novel as a whole. From the outset, we know that this tale of lost children will not have a happy ending, but the bleakness in store for these characters still has plenty of room to unnerve.&#x201d; -- Tobias Carroll, Words Without Borders DailyGr�goire Courtois lives in Burgundy, France, where he runs his own independent bookstore.

He is still very active as a public speaker on life in Berlin during the Nazi period.Beck, director of Berlin's Jewish Adult Education Center, recalls his youth and his work in the anti-Nazi resistance under most unusual circumstances. Beck was half of a pair of twins (with his sister Margot) born to an interfaith couple in Weimar Germany. Beck was one of those rare fortunate gay men who recognized his sexual orientation while still very young and who had a tolerant, loving, and supportive family who never for an instant were troubled by his lifestyle. He was equally lucky that his kin on the Christian side of the family felt the same toward their new Jewish relatives. Those facts are an inextricable element in his story of growing up Jewish in Nazi Germany. When Hitler came to power in 1933, Beck and his family found themselves, like other Jews, almost immediately stigmatized by law and separated forcibly from their non-Jewish friends and neighbors. After a lengthy series of humiliations, he was forced to leave his nondenominational school for a Jewish one. Beck is one of those quietly feisty types who are spurred by rejection into action; plunged into an entirely Jewish milieu, he quickly embraced the Zionist movement. Just as quickly, he embraced many of its male adherents, and the author is charmingly frank (but not explicit) about his sex life as well as his clandestine political activities. He would survive the war living as an ``illegal'' in Berlin, becoming a central figure in the underdocumented Zionist resistance that functioned despite the Nazis. Beck is a witty, chatty figure, and Heibert and Brown have done a splendid job of capturing and conveying his voice. The result is a readable and entertaining memoir of a terrible time. Beck is apparently at work on a sequel that takes him from the end of the war up to the present; its a book to look forward to. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

And yet the transformation of Eastern European countries gave rise to a bitter repudiation of liberalism itself, not only there but also back in the heartland of the West.<br><br> In this brilliant work of political history, Ivan Krastev and Stephen Holmes argue that the supposed end of Communism turned out to be only the beginning of the age of the autocrat. Reckoning with the history of the last thirty years, they show that the most powerful force behind the wave of populist xenophobia that began in Eastern Europe stems from resentment at the post-1989 imperative to become Westernized.<br><br> Through this prism, the Trump revolution represents an ironic fulfillment of the promise that the nations exiting from communist rule would come to resemble the United States.

Gloria Whelan manages to take the fly-on-the-wall approach one step further in her latest piece of historical fiction. In <i>Angel on the Square</i>, a young girl joins Russian Tsar Nikolai II, Empress Alexandra, and their children when her mother becomes one of the empress's ladies-in-waiting. Katya Ivanova, as companion to the Romanov children, has an insider's view of the crumbling of tsarist Russia from 1913 to 1918. Initially, life is lavish and amusing for this young aristocrat, although her friend Misha's revolutionary ideas often battle in her mind with her own loyalty to the tsar. Gradually, though, the world outside begins to enter the palace walls, and Katya's life--along with that of all nobility--changes forever.<p> Whelan's balanced treatment of both sides of the Russian revolution is remarkably accessible. Katya is an appealing protagonist; readers will hang on her every word as she is transformed from a spoiled, sheltered child into a caring, hard-working adult. Young readers couldn't ask for a better introduction to this terrifying, earthshaking epoch in history.

In this volume, her first to appear in English, she offers a fascinating window into some of the liveliest and most colorful stories in the Talmud. Calderon rewrites talmudic tales as richly imagined fictions, drawing us into the lives of such characters as the woman who risks her life for a sister suspected of adultery; a humble schoolteacher who rescues his village from drought; and a wife who dresses as a prostitute to seduce her pious husband in their garden.

Maybe the phone rang, and then Bonnie called my name. </p><p> Bright sun shone in the window, and the skies were clear as far as I could see. There was a beautiful woman of the Caribbean lying next to me. From the living room, early morning cartoons were squeaking softly while Feather giggled as quietly as she could. Somewhere below the blue skies, Jesus was hammering away, building a single mast sail that he intended to navigate toward some deep unknown dream. </p><p> It was one of the most perfect mornings of my life. I had a steady job, a nice house with a garden in the backyard, and a loving family. </p><p> But I was nowhere near happy. </p><p> The phone rang again. </p><p> "Easy," Bonnie said. </p><p> "I hear it." </p><p> "Daddy, phone," Feather yelled from her TV post. </p><p> Her dog, Frenchie, growled in anger just to hear her say something to me. </p><p> Jesus stopped his hammering. </p><p> The phone rang again. </p><p> "Honey," Bonnie insisted. </p><p> I almost said something sharp, but instead I grabbed the receiver off the night table. </p><p> "Yeah?" </p><p> "Ezekiel?" </p><p> Ezekiel is my given name but I never use it. So when that deep voice came out of the phone, I stalled a moment, wondering if it was asking for someone else. </p><p> "Ezekiel?" the voice said again. </p><p> "Who is this?" </p><p> "I'm lookin' for Raymond," the near-bass voice said. </p><p> "Mouse is dead." </p><p> I sat up, pulling the blankets from Bonnie's side of the bed. She didn't reach for the sheets to cover her naked body. I liked that. I might have even smiled. </p><p> "Oh no," the voice assured me. "He ain't dead." </p><p> "What?" </p><p> "No." The voice was almost an echo. There was a click and I knew that the connection had been broken. </p><p> "Easy?" Bonnie said. </p><p> I put the phone back into its cradle. </p><p> "Easy, who was it?" </p><p> Bonnie pressed her warm body against my back. The memory of Raymond's death brought about the slight nausea of guilt. Add that to the heat of the woman I loved and I had to pull away. I went to the window. </p><p> Down in the backyard I saw the frame of Jesus's small boat on orange crates and sawhorses in the middle of the lawn. </p><p> "It was ...a woman I think. Deep voice." </p><p> "What did she want?" </p><p> "Mouse." </p><p> "Oh. She didn't know he was dead," Bonnie said in that way she had of making everything okay with just a few words. </p><p> "She said he was alive." </p><p> "What?" </p><p> "I don't think she knew. It was more like she was certain that he couldn't be dead." </p><p> "That's just the way people think about him," Bonnie said. </p><p> "No. It was something else." </p><p> "What do you mean?" </p><p> I went back to the bed and took Bonnie's hands in mine. "Do you have to leave today?" I asked her. </p><p> "Sorry." </p><p> Jesus's hammer started its monotonous beat again. </p><p> Feather turned up the volume on Crusader Rabbit now that she knew we were awake. </p><p> "I know you got to go," I said. "But..." </p><p> "What?" </p><p> "I dreamt about my father last night." </p><p> She reached out and touched my cheek with her palm. Bonnie had work-woman hands, not callused, but hard from a long life of doing for herself and others. </p><p> "What did he say?" she asked me. </p><p> That was her superstitious streak. She believed that the dead could speak through dreams. </p><p> "He didn't say a thing," I said. "Just sat there in a chair on a raft in the water. I called out to him four or five times before he looked up. But just then the current started pullin' the raft downstream. I think he saw me but before he could say anything he was too far away." </p><p> Bonnie took my head in her arms and held on tight. I didn't try to pull away.</p><p> </p><p> We sat down to breakfast at nine o'clock, two hours after I was supposed to be at work. Jesus had taken Feather to school. After that he was going to work four hours as a box boy at Tolucca Market on Robertson. In the late afternoon he'd come back home and read to me from Treasure Island. That was our deal: he'd read out loud to me for forty-five minutes and then discuss what he had read for three quarters of an hour more. He did that every day, and I agreed to let him drop out of high school. </p><p> Jesus wasn't interested in a public school education, and there was nothing I could do to light a fire under him. He was smart about things he cared for. He knew everything about grocery stores because of his job. He worked there and did gardening around our neighborhood to afford his boat dreams. He liked carpentry and running. He loved to cook and explore the beaches up and down the coast around L.A. </p><p> "What are you thinking about?" Bonnie asked. </p><p> We were holding hands under the table like schoolchildren going steady. </p><p> "Juice," I said. "He's doin' pretty good." </p><p> "Then why do you look so sad?" </p><p> "I don't know. Maybe it's that phone call." </p><p> Bonnie leaned closer and squeezed my hand. "I'm going to be gone longer than usual," she said. </p><p> "How long?" </p><p> "Maybe three or four weeks. Air France is having a special junket around western Africa with black political leaders and some European corporate heads. They need a French-speaking black stewardess who can also speak English. They'll need me on call for special flights." </p><p> "Oh. Yeah." It felt like she was punishing me for feeling bad. </p><p> "I told you that I'd have to be gone sometimes," she said sweetly. </p><p> "That's okay," I said. "Just don't go believin' it when one'a those men says that he wants to make you his queen."</p><p> </p><p> Hundreds of children were assembled in front of Sojourner Truth Junior High School when I arrived -- three and a half hours late. </p><p> "Mr. Rawlins," Archie "Ace" Muldoon said, greeting me on the granite stair of the main building. Short and balding, the little white man doffed his White Sox baseball cap in deference to his boss -- me. </p><p> "Hey, Ace. What's happenin' here?" </p><p> "Fire in the metal shop bungalow." </p><p> "But that's down on the lower campus. Why they wanna evacuate up here?" </p><p> "Mr. Newgate." That's all he needed to say. Our principal, Hiram Newgate, was the source of all discord and wasted energy. </p><p> "Rawlins, I want to talk to you," Newgate said from the entrance hall. It was as if Archie conjured him up by saying his name. </p><p> "What about, Hiram?" I called back. </p><p> Newgate's lip curled into a snarl at my disrespectful tone. </p><p> He was tall and scarecrow-thin with cheekbones that were almost as high as his eyes. He would have been ugly if he didn't have perfect grooming, bright white and immaculate teeth, and clothes bought only in the finest Beverly Hills stores. That day he was wearing a shark-gray jacket and slender-cut black slacks. </p><p> He was looking good but I had outdone him. I was dressed in one of my best suits; off-white linen with felt buff shoes, brown argyle socks and tan shirt that I kept open at the collar due to the nature of my job,which was supervising senior head custodian. </p><p> I liked dressing up because of my background, which was poor and secondhand. But it also gave me a secret pleasure to see Newgate look me up and down, comparing my clothes to his. </p><p> "Where have you been?" the jade-eyed principal asked me. </p><p> I shrugged, not having enough respect for the man to lie. </p><p> "That's not an acceptable answer." </p><p> "What's the fire report, Archie?" I asked my custodian. </p><p> "Fire captain's down in the yard," the small man said. </p><p> "Mr. Rawlins," Principal Newgate sputtered. "I'm speaking to you." </p><p> "Sorry, Hiram," I said as I walked away. "But I'm late and there's going to be a lot of paperwork around this fire." </p><p> "What?" he exclaimed. He probably said a lot more, but I touched Archie's arm and we went quickly toward the stairway that led down to the lower campus.</p><p> </p><p> The metal shop bungalow was slightly scorched when the firemen arrived. They had reduced the building to splinters by the time they were through. </p><p> It was a strange vision for me. A burnt and shattered building surrounded by white men dressed in red. They were all young and grinning. Outside the nearby chain-link fence were dozens of men and women among the displaced students -- all of them black or brown -- staring wide-eyed at the demolition. I could feel my heart thumping and my hands getting hot. </p><p> A fireman approached us. He was hatless and haggard, no older than I, but he looked to be ready for retirement. He was making his way toward us with a deliberate and tired gait. </p><p> "You the principal?" the old-looking fireman asked. His gray pupils were watery, almost white. </p><p> "No," I said. "My name is Rawlins. I'm the plant supervisor." </p><p> "Where's the principal?" </p><p> "Mosta the kids're on the upper campus. He's makin' like a general on his horse up there, keepin' the troops from deserting." </p><p> That got a laugh from the fire captain. He reached out to shake my hand. </p><p> "Gregson," he said. "I'm the shift commander. Looks like you got a problem here." </p><p> I glanced at the poor colored people looking in at those uniformed marauders. I wondered if Gregson and I saw the same problems. </p><p> "It's arson," the fireman continued. "We found a scorched gasoline can under the building. It's a pretty sophisticated incendiary smoke bomb." </p><p> "They set it off with people in there?" </p><p> "Weren't you here?" Gregson asked me. </p><p> "I was late today." </p><p> "Oh. Well, somebody pulled the fire alarm and then set off the device, or maybe they set it off and then pulled the alarm. Maybe someone else saw the smoke but I doubt it; the people in the classroom hadn't even seen it yet. They pulled the alarm on the wall of the janitors' bungalow."</p><p> </p><p> I borrowed some lined paper and a pencil from one of the students, through the fence, and took down all the information: Gregson's phone number, the police number to call to give information to the arson squad, and the names and numbers of the forms I had to fill out. He told me that an inspector would show up in the afternoon. All the while the firemen prowled around the shattered building, using their axes just in case some embers still burned. </p><p> I went up to Principal Newgate's office after that. I detested the man but he was still my boss. </p><p> "I'll buzz him, ...</p></p><h2>Imagining America: Stories from the Promised Land, Revised Edition</h2><p><p><strong>The acclaimed multicultural fiction anthology, updated to include recent writers.</strong></p> Thirty-seven short stories from 1900 to the present, written by some of our best authors&#x2015;African, Asian, European, Jewish, Middle Eastern, and Native American&#x2015;follow the waves of immigration into and migration within the United States. These stories are unique in time and circumstance, yet they address a common dilemma: how to reconcile America's mythologized "promise" with its more complex reality. New to the collection are Sherman Alexie, Michelle Cliff, Edwidge Danticat, Junot Diaz, Chitra Divakaruni, Jewelle Gomez, Thomas King, Bruce Morrow, Agnes Rossi, and David Wong Louie. They join Toni Cade Bambara, Richard Bausch, Marita Bonner, Nash Candelaria, Sandra Cisneros, Louise Erdrich, Mei Mei Evans, Oscar Hijuelos, Gish Jen, LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka, Kim Yong Ik, Monfoon Leong, Bernard Malamud, Paule Marshall, Nicholasa Mohr, Toshio Mori, Bharati Mukherjee, Mikhail Naimy, Tahira Naqvi, Gregory Orfalea, Grace Paley, Jeanne Schinto, Leslie Marmon Silko, Michael Stephens, Sui Sin Far, Alice Walker, and Hisaye Yamamoto&#x2015;making this, once again, the most authoritative and useful multicultural collection available.</p><p><p><b>Wesley Brown</b>, novelist and playwright, is also the editor of <i>Imagining America</i> and <i>Visions of America</i>. He is on the faculty of Rutgers University.</p><p><b>Amy Ling</b> (d. 1999), critic and scholar, was the founding director of the Asian American Studies Program at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.</p>Although the multiculturalistic focus will seem trendy to some, this compilation demonstrates what a tangy stew simmers in the American melting pot. Once an accomplished Berlin journalist, Bernard Malamud's Jewish refugee is haunted by Nazi atrocities and "a terrible sense of useless tongue"; Mary Gordon's lame Irish American reinvents herself as a secretarial whiz to the exclusion of greenhorn friends; and upon his arrival in Florida, Kim Yong Ik's Korean student finds that a happy-go-lucky American soldier he had befriended at home is an impoverished alcoholic. The cultures represented here are disparate but the deeply felt experiences of alienation and assimilation are strikingly similar. In Jack Forbes's scenario, a basketball team is disqualified from an all-Indian tournament because its tribe is not federally recognized; Gish Jen's first-generation Chinese American narrator has a father who runs his pancake business like a paternalistic overlord and a mother who wants to join the local country club; Oscar Hijuelos's struggling Cubans give safe harbor to newer emigres who then out-prosper their benefactors; and Toni Cade Bambara's young black protagonist gets an unwelcome lesson on the difference between society's haves and have-nots.

Its hero, Coriolanus, is a proud General who does not hesitate to show his arrogant and outspoken contempt of the Roman rabble. The Tribunes banish him and he raises an army to take his revenge on Rome. He finally concedes to the pleas of his mother to spare the city and leaves only to be publicly killed by his former allies.</p><p>Peter Holland is a former Director of the Shakespeare Institute in Stratford-upon-Avon and President of the Shakespeare Association of America. He is a pre-eminent international scholar. His comprehensive introduction and commentary notes open up the language, themes and ideas in this complex yet richly rewarding play for the student and teacher. The play is discussed in its historical and critical contexts and its theatrical history is analysed too.</p></p><p>This generously annotated edition of Coriolanus offers a thorough reconsideration of Shakespeare&#39;s remarkable, and probably his last, tragedy. A substantial introduction situates the play within its contemporary social and political contexts and presents a fresh account of how the protagonist&#39;s personal tragedy evolves within Shakespeare&#39;s most searching exploration of the political life of a community. The edition is alert throughout to the play&#39;s theatrical potential, while the stage history also attends to the politics of performance from the 1680s to the 1990s, including European productions following the Second World War.This edition presents a new look at Coriolanus in accordance with the work of the Shakespeare and Schools Project, the national curriculum for English and developments at GCSE and A level. Cambridge School Shakespeare considers the play as theatre and the text as script, enabling pupils to inhabit the imaginative world of the play in an accessible, meaningful and creative way.</p><h2>Restoring Williamsburg</h2><p><b>A comprehensive look at Williamsburg's evolution and important role in defining our understanding of 18th-century America</b><br><br> Today best known as the world&#x2019;s largest &#x201c;living history&#x201d; museum, Williamsburg was the capital of the colony of Virginia in the 1700s and the setting for key debates leading to the American Revolution. Inspired by growing interest in America&#x2019;s colonial heritage, W. A. R. Goodwin, supported by John D.

He brings enormous ideas down to earth where we all live and helps us to see how&#x2015;as Dallas Willard used to say&#x2015;&#x201c;We can live our lives the way Jesus would live our lives . . . if Jesus had our lives to live.&#x201d; And Jesus is supposed to have our lives to live. Carl brings amazingly simple, insightful, and practical suggestions directly from the life of Jesus . . . and offers them to us to practice in our real, everyday lives. (Bart Tarman, speaker, artist, and former chaplain of Westmont College)<br><br>I am a big fan of Carl Medearis. He&#x2019;s always fun yet challenging, provocative yet deeply biblical. In <i>42 Seconds</i>, he is no different. Exploring the art of getting to the point with people just like Jesus did is so necessary in our present cultural moment. You will be blessed and challenged by this book. (Daniel Fusco, poast of Crossroads Community Church)<br><br>Jesus is the most disruptive person who ever lived, because he&#x2019;s always focused on growth, not on perpetuating the status quo. Likewise, my Jesus-loving friend Carl Medearis is one of the most disruptive people I&#x2019;ve ever met&#x2015;you&#x2019;ll see what I mean when you read <i>42 Seconds</i>. These short bursts of truth, at times hilarious and at times profound, will move you deeper into a lifestyle that produces fruit in others&#x2019; lives. Listen and learn from Carl, and you&#x2019;ll leave the status quo behind for something like an epic adventure. (Rick Lawrence, author of The Jesus-Centered Life)<br><br>It&#x2019;s amazing how often our words and actions can make the Good News Jesus proclaimed and embodied sound and look like Bad News. Our world is in desperate need of Jesus people to take seriously our invitation to speak, think, and act in ways reflective of the One we follow. In this book, Carl offers a relatable, thoughtful, and extremely tangible guide for how to not only say we believe in the Good News but also narrate it with our lives.

Allied troops were sweeping through Nazi Germany and discovering the atrocities of SS concentration camps. The first to be reached intact was Buchenwald, in central Germany. American soldiers struggled to make sense of the shocking scenes they witnessed inside. They asked a small group of former inmates to draft a report on the camp. It was led by Eugen Kogon, a German political prisoner who had been an inmate since 1939. <i>The Theory and Practice of Hell</i> is his classic account of life inside.</p><p>Unlike many other books by survivors who published immediately after the war, <i>The Theory and Practice of Hell</i> is more than a personal account. It is a horrific examination of life and death inside a Nazi concentration camp, a brutal world of a state within state, and a society without law. But Kogon maintains a dispassionate and critical perspective. He tries to understand how the camp works, to uncover its structure and social organization. He knew that the book would shock some readers and provide others with gruesome fascination. But he firmly believed that he had to show the camp in honest, unflinching detail.</p><p>The result is a unique historical document&#x2015;a complete picture of the society, morality, and politics that fueled the systematic torture of six million human beings. For many years, <i>The Theory and Practice of Hell</i> remained the seminal work on the concentration camps, particularly in Germany. Reissued with an introduction by Nikolaus Waschmann, a leading Holocaust scholar and author of Hilter's Prisons, this important work now demands to be re-read.</p></p><p><p><b>Nikolaus Wachsmann</b> is a professor of Modern German History at the University of London and the author of <i>Hitler's Prisons: Legal Terror in Nazi Germany.</i></p><p><b>Dr. Eugen Kogon</b> was a political prisoner at Buchenwald from September 1939 to April 1945.

According to Voltaire, it represented "a worthless collection of miracles, a disgrace for the human mind"; for Hegel, it was "a disgusting picture of imbecility."<br><br><em>A Cabinet of Byzantine Curiosities</em> will churn up these old prejudices, while also stimulating a deeper interest among readers in one of history's most interesting civilizations. Many of the zanier tales and trivia that are collected here revolve around the political and religious life of Byzantium. Thus, stories of saints, relics, and their miracles-from the hilarious to the revolting-abound. Byzantine bureaucracy (whence the adjective "Byzantine"), court scandals, and elaborate penal code are world famous. And what would Byzantium be without its eunuchs, whose ambiguous gender produced odd and risible outcomes in different contexts? The book also contains sections on daily life that are equally eye-opening, including food (from aphrodisiacs to fermented fish sauce), games such as polo and acrobatics, and obnoxious views of foreigners and others (e.g., Germans, Catholics, Arabs, dwarves). But lest we overlook Byzantium's more honorable contributions to civilization, also included are some of the marvels of Byzantine science and technology, from the military (flamethrowers and hand grenades) to the theatrical ("elevator" thrones, roaring mechanical lions) and medical (catheters and cures, some bizarre). This vast assortment of historical anomaly and absurdity sheds vital light on one of history's most obscure and orthodox empires.<br></p><p><br><strong>Anthony Kaldellis </strong>is Professor of Classics at The Ohio State University, and the author of <em>The Christian Parthenon: Classicism and Pilgrimage in Byzantine Athens, Hellenism in Byzantium: The Transformations of Greek Identity and the Reception of the Classical Tradition,</em> and <em>Streams of Gold, Rivers</em> <em>of Blood: The Rise and Fall of Byzantium, 955 A.D. to the First Crusade.</em><br><br>"If the Holy Spirit was not ashamed to tell this story, how much less should we place it under a shadow." --John Chrysostom, <em>Homily on the Gospel of Matthew</em> <br><p></p><br>"I rarely ever finish, or even read, books, but I finished this one!" --Anonymous <br><p></p><br>"Pray for the author, pray for him, for he is wretched and unworthy."

Written in short, carefully numbered paragraphs of extreme brilliance, it captured the imagination of a generation of philosophers. For Wittgenstein, logic was something we use to conquer a reality which is in itself both elusive and unobtainable. He famously summarized the book in the following words: 'What can be said at all can be said clearly; and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence.' David Pears and Brian McGuinness received the highest praise for their meticulous translation. The work is prefaced by Bertrand Russell's original introduction to the first English edition.</p><p>Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889 - 1951) is regarded by many as the most outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Evergreen Springs: A Clean &amp; Wholesome Romance (Haven Point, 3)</h2><p><b>Celebrate the magic of Christmas in Haven Point with New York Times bestselling author RaeAnne Thayne, where hope, home and happily-ever-after are as close as your holiday stocking...&nbsp;</b><br><br>Christmas is the last thing on Cole Barrett's mind this year.

While a juicy trauma might be professionally stimulating and serve to break up the monotony, she adored all her neighbors in Haven Point and the greater Lake Haven area too much to wish that sort of stress and pain on anyone.<br><br>Better to be stuck at the nurses' station of the small emergency department trying without success&#x2014;and not for the first time, alas&#x2014;to learn how to knit.<br><br>"No. Your problem here has to do with the amount of tension on the working yarn," Greta Ward insisted. "If you don't have the right tension, you'll end up losing control and making a huge mess you will only have to undo."<br><br>The scarily efficient charge nurse of the emergency department at the Lake Haven Hospital leaned over her and tugged the yarn around her fingers in some kind of complicated way that Devin knew she would never be able to replicate.<br><br>"There. That's better. Try again."<br><br>Devin concentrated, nibbling on her bottom lip as she tried to work the needles that seemed unwieldy and awkward, no matter how she tried.<br><br>After her third time tangling the yarn into a total mess, Devin sighed and admitted defeat. Again. Every time they happened to be assigned to work together, Greta took a moment to try teaching her to knit. And every time, she came up short.<br><br>"People who find knitting at all relaxing have to be crazy. I think I must have some kind of mental block. It's just not coming."<br><br>"You're not trying hard enough," Greta insisted.<br><br>"I am! I swear I am."<br><br>"Even my eight-year-old granddaughter can do it," she said sternly. "Once you get past the initial learning curve, this is something you'll love the rest of your life."<br><br>"I think it's funny." Callie Bennett, one of the other nurses and also one of Devin's good friends, smirked as she observed her pitiful attempts over the top of her magazine.<br><br>"Oh, yes. Hilarious," Devin said drily.<br><br>"It is! You're a physician who can set a fractured radius, suture a screaming six-year-old's finger and deliver a baby, all with your eyes closed."<br><br>"Not quite," Devin assured her. "I open my eyes at the end of childbirth so I can see to cut the umbilical cord."<br><br>Callie chuckled. "Seriously, you're one of the best doctors at this hospital. I love working with you and wish you worked here permanently. You're cool under pressure and always seem to know just how to deal with every situation. But I hate to break it to you, hon, you're all thumbs when it comes to knitting, no matter how hard you try."<br><br>"I'm going to get the hang of this tonight," she insisted. "If Greta's eight-year-old granddaughter can do it, so can I."<br><br>She picked up the needles again and concentrated under the watchful eye of the charge nurse until she'd successfully finished the first row of what she hoped would eventually be a scarf.<br><br>"Not bad," Greta said. "Now just do that about four hundred more times and you might have enough for a decent-sized scarf."<br><br>Devin groaned. Already, she was wishing she had stuck to reading the latest medical journals to pass the time instead of trying to knit yet again.<br><br>"I've got to go back to my office and finish the schedule for next month," Greta said. "Keep going and remember&#x2014;ten rows a day keeps the psychiatrist away."<br><br>Devin laughed but didn't look up from the stitches.<br><br>"How do you always pick the slowest nights to fill in?" Callie asked after Greta left the nurses' station.<br><br>"I have no idea. Just lucky, I guess."<br><br>It wasn't exactly true. Her nights weren't always quiet. The past few times she had substituted for the regular emergency department doctors at Lake Haven Hospital had been low-key like this one, but that definitely wasn't always the case. A month earlier, she worked the night of the first snowfall and had been on her feet all night, between car accidents, snow shovel injuries and a couple of teenagers who had taken a snowmobile through a barbed-wire fence.<br><br>Like so much of medicine, emergency medicine was all a roll of the dice.<br><br>Devin loved her regular practice as a family physician in partnership with Russell Warrick, who had been her own doctor when she was a kid. She loved having a day-to-day relationship with her patients and the idea that she could treat an entire family from cradle to grave.<br><br>Even so, she didn't mind filling in at the emergency department when the three rotating emergency medicine physicians in the small hospital needed an extra hand. The challenge and variety of it exercised her brain and sharpened her reflexes&#x2014;except tonight, when the only thing sharp seemed to be these knitting needles that had become her nemesis.<br><br>She was on her twelfth row when she heard a commotion out in the reception area.<br><br>"We need a doctor here, right now."<br><br>"Can you tell me what's going on?" Devin heard the receptionist ask in a calm voice.<br><br>Devin didn't wait around to hear the answer. She and Callie both sprang into action. Though the emergency department usually followed triage protocol, with prospective patients screened by one of the certified nurse assistants first to determine level of urgency, that seemed superfluous when the newcomers were the only patients here. By default, they automatically moved to the front of the line, since there wasn't one.<br><br>She walked through the doorway to the reception desk and her initial impression was of a big, tough-looking man, a very pregnant woman in one of the hospital wheelchairs and a couple of scared-looking kids.<br><br>"What's the problem?"<br><br>"Are you a doctor?" the man demanded. "I know how emergency rooms work. You tell your story to a hundred different people before you finally see somebody who can actually help you. I don't want to go through that."<br><br>She gave a well-practiced smile. "I'm Dr. Shaw, the attending physician here tonight. What seems to be the problem?"<br><br>"Devin? Is that you?"<br><br>The pregnant woman looked up and met her gaze and Devin immediately recognized her. "Tricia!<br><br>Hello."<br><br>Tricia Barrett had been a friend in high school, though she hadn't seen her in years. Barrett had been her maiden name, anyway. Devin couldn't remember the last name of the man she married.<br><br>"Hi," Tricia said, her features pale and her arms tight on the armrests of the wheelchair. "I would say it's great to see you again, but, well, not really, under these circumstances. No offense."<br><br>Devin stepped closer to her and gave her a calming smile. "None taken. Believe me, I get it. Why don't you tell me what's going on."<br><br>Tricia shifted in the wheelchair. "Nothing. Someone is overreacting."<br><br>"She slipped on a patch of ice about an hour ago and hurt her ankle." The man with her overrode her objections. "I'm not sure it's broken but she needs an X-ray."<br><br>At first she thought he might be Tricia's husband but on closer inspection, she recognized him, only because she'd seen him around town here and there over the past few years.<br><br>Cole Barrett, Tricia's older brother, was a rather hard man to overlook&#x2014;six feet two inches of gor-geousness, with vivid blue eyes, sinfully long eyelashes and sun-streaked brown hair usually hidden by a cowboy hat.<br><br>He had been wild back in the day, if she remembered correctly, and still hadn't lost that edgy, bad-boy outlaw vibe.<br><br>In a small community like Haven Point, most people knew each other&#x2014;or at least knew <em>of</em> each other. She hadn't met the man but she knew he lived in the mountains above town and that he had inherited a sprawling, successful ranch from his grandparents.<br><br>If memory served, he had once been some kind of hotshot rodeo cowboy.<br><br>With that afternoon shadow and his wavy brown hair a little disordered, he looked as if he had just climbed either off a horse or out of some lucky woman's bed. Not that it was any of her business. Disreputable cowboys were definitely <em>not</em> her type.<br><br>Devin dismissed the man from her mind and focused instead on her patient, where her attention should have been in the first place.<br><br>"Have you been able to put weight on your ankle?"<br><br>"No, but I haven't really tried. This is all so silly," Tricia insisted. "I'm sure it's not broken."<br><br>She winced suddenly, her face losing another shade or two of color, and pressed a hand to her abdomen.<br><br>Devin didn't miss the gesture and her attention sharpened. "How long have you been having contractions?"<br><br>"I'm sure they're only Braxton Hicks."<br><br>"How far along are you?"<br><br>"Thirty-four weeks. With twins, if you couldn't tell by the basketball here."<br><br>Her brother frowned. "You're having contractions? Why didn't you say anything?"<br><br>"Because you're already freaking out over a stupid sprained ankle. I didn't want to send you into total panic mode."<br><br>"What's happening?" the girl said. "What are contractions?"<br><br>"It's something a woman's body does when she's almost ready to have a baby," Tricia explained.<br><br>"Are you having the babies <em>tonight?"</em> she asked, big blue eyes wide. "I thought they weren't supposed to be here until after Christmas."<br><br>"I hope not," Tricia answered. "Sometimes I guess you have practice contractions. I'm sure that's what these are."<br><br>For the first time, she started to look uneasy and Devin knew she needed to take control of the situation.<br><br>"I don't want to send you up to Obstetrics until we take a look at the ankle. We can hook up all the fetal monitoring equipment down here in the emergency department to see what's going on and put your minds at ease."<br><br>"Thanks. I'm sure everything's fine. I'm going to be embarrassed for worrying everyone."<br><br>"Never worry about that," Devin assured her.<br><br>"I'm sorry to bother you, but I need to get some information so we can enter it into the computer and make an ID band." Brittney Calloway, the receptionist, stepped forward, clipboard in hand.<br><br>"My insurance information is in my purse," Tricia said. "Cole, can you find it and give her what she needs?"<br><br>He looked as if he didn't want to leave his sister's side but the little boy was already looking bored.<br><br>Whose were they? The girl looked to be about eight, blonde and ethereal like Tricia but with Cole's blue eyes, and the boy was a few years younger with darker coloring and big brown eyes.<br><br>She hadn't heard the man had kids&#x2014;in fact, as far as she knew, he had lived alone at Evergreen Springs the past two years since his grandmother died.<br><br>"You can come back to the examination room after you're done out here, or you can stay out in the waiting room."<br><br>He looked at the children and then back at his sister, obviously torn. "We'll wait out here, if you think you'll be okay."<br><br>"I'll be fine," she assured him. "I'm sorry to be such a pain."<br><br>He gave his sister a soft, affectionate smile that would have made Devin's knees go weak, if she weren't made of sterner stuff. "You're not a pain. You're just stubborn," he said gruffly. "You should have called me the minute you fell instead of waiting until I came back to the house and you definitely should have said something about the contractions."<br><br>"We'll take care of her and try to keep you posted."<br><br>"Thanks." He nodded and shepherded the two children to the small waiting room, with his sister's purse in hand.<br><br>Devin forced herself to put him out of her mind and focus on her patient.<br><br>Normally, the nurses and aides would take a patient into a room and start a chart but since she knew Tricia and the night was slow, Devin didn't mind coming into her care from the beginning.<br><br>"You're thirty-three weeks?" she asked as she pushed her into the largest exam room in the department.<br><br>"Almost thirty-four.

The girl is measuring bigger, according to my ob-gyn back in California."<br><br>"Did your OB clear you for travel this close to your due date?"<br><br>"Yes. Everything has been uncomplicated. A textbook pregnancy, Dr. Adams said."<br><br>"When was your last appointment?"<br><br>"I saw my regular doctor the morning before Thanksgiving. She knew I was flying out to spend the holiday with Cole and the kids. I was supposed to be back the next Sunday, but, well, I decided to stay."<br><br>She paused and her chin started to quiver. "Everything is such a mess and I can't go home and now I've sprained my ankle. How am I going to get around on crutches when I'm as big as a barn?"<br><br>Something else was going on here, something that had nothing to do with sprained ankles. Why couldn't she go home? Devin squeezed her hand. "Let's not get ahead of ourselves."<br><br>"No. You're right." Tricia drew a breath. When she spoke her voice only wobbled a little. "I have an appointment Monday for a checkup with a local doctor. Randall or Crandall or something like that. I can't remember. I just know my records have been transferred there."<br><br>"Randall. Jim Randall."<br><br>He was one of her favorite colleagues in the area, compassionate and kind and more than competent. Whenever she had a complicated obstetrics patient in her family medicine practice, she sent her to Jim.<br><br>As Devin guided Tricia from the wheelchair to the narrow bed in the room, the pregnant woman paused on the edge, her hand curved around her abdomen and her face contorted with pain. She drew in a sharp breath and let it out slowly. "Ow. That was a big one."<br><br>And not far apart from the first contraction she'd had a few minutes earlier, Devin thought in concern, her priorities shifting as Callie came in. "Here we are. This is Callie. She's an amazing nurse and right now she's going to gather some basic information and help you into a gown. I'll be back when she's done to take a look at things."<br><br>Tricia grabbed her hand. "You'll be back?"<br><br>"In just a moment, I promise. I'm going to write orders for the X-ray and the fetal heartbeat monitoring and put a call in to Dr. Randall. I'll also order some basic urine and blood tests, too, then I'll be right back."<br><br>"Okay. Okay." Tricia gave a wobbly smile. "Thanks. I can't tell you how glad I am that you're here."<br><br>"I'm not going anywhere. I promise."</p><h2>Each Day a New Beginning Journal: A Meditation Book and Journal for Daily Reflection (Hazelden Meditations)</h2><p><b>These meditations, one for each day of the year, speak to the common experience, shared struggles, and unique strengths of a woman, especially those seeking support and spiritual growth in recovery.</b><br><br>"Let me be grateful for my lessons today and know that all is well."<br> <br>Inspired by millions of women who have made <i>Each Day a New Beginning</i> their daily companion, this journal version of the beloved meditation book allows you to personalize favorite passages.

(<i>Mary Breu</i>)</p><h2>Hard to Handle: The Life and Death of the Black Crowes--A Memoir</h2><p><b>An insider biography of the Black Crowes by drummer and cofounder Steve Gorman</b><br><br>For over two decades, the Black Crowes topped the charts and reigned supreme over the radio waves, even as hair bands, grunge, and hip-hop threatened to dethrone them. With hits like "Hard to Handle," "She Talks to Angels," and "Remedy," their massive success launched them to stardom in the early '90s, earning them a place among rock royalty. They were on the cover of <i>Rolling Stone, </i>MTV played their videos 24/7, and Generation X re-discovered the power of classic rock and blues by digging into multi-platinum classics like <i>Shake Your Money Maker </i>and <i>The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion</i>.<br><br> But stardom can be fleeting. For the Black Crowes, success slowly dwindled as the band members got caught up in the rock star world and lost sight of their musical ambition. Despite the drinking, drugs, and incessant fighting between Chris and Rich Robinson--the angriest brothers in rock and roll, with all due respect to Oasis and the Kinks--the band continued to tour until 2013. On any given night, they could be the best band you ever saw. (Or the most combative.) Then, one last rift caused by Chris Robinson proved insurmountable for the band to survive. After that, the Black Crowes would fly no more.<br><br> Founding member Steve Gorman was there for all of it--the coke and weed-fueled tours; the tumultuous recording sessions; the backstage hangs with legends like Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, and the Rolling Stones. As the band's drummer and voice of reason, he tried to keep the Black Crowes together musically--and in one piece emotionally. In his first-person history of the Black Crowes, <i>Hard To Handle</i>--the first ever account of this great American rock band's beginning, middle, and end--Gorman makes it clear just how impossible that job was. Fortunately, Gorman tells the tale with great insight, candor, and humor. They don't make bands like the Black Crowes anymore: crazy, brilliant, self-destructive, inspiring, and, ultimately, not built to last. But, man, what a ride it was while it lasted.<br></p><p><b>Steve Gorman</b> is a founding member of the Black Crowes as well as his current band, Trigger Hippy. He has created and hosted two nationally syndicated radio shows. <i>Hard to Handle</i> is his first book. He lives in Nashville with his wife and two kids.<br><br> <b>Steven Hyden</b> is the author of <i>Your Favorite Band Is Killing Me </i>and<i> Twilight of the Gods. </i>His work has also appeared in the <i>New York Times Magazine, Washington Post, Billboard, Rolling Stone, Grantland, The. A.V. Club, Uproxx, </i>and <i>The Ringer. </i>"One of the year's most buzzed-about rock bios!"&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>JamBase</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Bands are beautiful fragile toxic things--always one wrong glance or argument away from falling apart. Steve manages to tell the tale of the internal turmoil of the Black Crowes, in all its sordid detail, without ever getting finger-pointy about it. I honestly couldn't put it down. Made me nostalgic, sad, and happy too."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Chris Shiflett, lead guitarist of Foo Fighters</b></i></b><br><br>"Reading this book brought me back to a time that rock and roll mattered to me more than almost anything else. I was at some of the early Black Crowes gigs depicted here, and the book is so well drawn, that I could not only hear the music again, but smell the sweat coming off the band and crowd as clearly as I did back then. This is <i>Almost Famous</i>, told by the guy behind the drums, who remembers every chord change, every fight, every song's journey from demo to record to live performance. Essential reading for rock fans everywhere."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Brian Koppelman, co-creator and showrunner of <i>Billions</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>Hard to Handle</i> is an amazing and a lot of times uncomfortably candid account of Steve's time in the Black Crowes. The opportunities presented and then lost. The ups and downs. The fights. The fuck ups. This book is literally the <i>Angela's Ashes</i> of rock memoirs. Every time things seem to be looking up for the band an insane decision, comment or substance seems to drive the band right into a ditch, only to see them somehow use that negative momentum to then attain a new level of success. I absolutely loved this book. Can't wait for the movie!"&#x2015;<b><i><b>Bill Burr, comedian</b></i></b><br><br>"I couldn't put the book down--absolutely unbelievable read! Now I know why I was lucky to play tennis; I didn't have to deal with anyone except myself!"&#x2015;<b><i><b>John McEnroe, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>But Seriously </i>and <i>You Cannot Be Serious</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A raw, intimate portrait of the band vividly unfolds as Gorman recounts his history with the Crowes, from their conception to their final days. While this is a familiar tale in some ways, Gorman sidesteps the usual clichees. The book is a reminder of the band's wide-ranging talent and great music... Gorman has written a brutally honest, deeply personal memoir of the group he helped to create. A must for fans of the Black Crowes and American rock and roll."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Library Journal </b></i></i></b><br><br>"Insightful and explosive....almost every page has some sort of jaw-dropping revelation...and Gorman was there from the very beginning to the last downbeat."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>The Houston Press</i></b></i></b></p><h2>Winning Chess Exercises for Kids</h2><p>This wonderfully entertaining book also happens to be quite effective. <p>Everything any child will need to know about chess strategy and more is here in this book, which is well laid out and easy to follow. </p><p>Part of the fun factor for kids is that the book is replete with cartoon images of chess characters to help make the learning experience more exciting. </p><p>A bright and colorful cover, as well as the large workbook format and algebraic notation make this a book which will occupy your child's attention for many hours. </p><p>The flexible "perfect binding" makes it easy to turn the pages and have them stay in place.</p></p><p>Jeff Coakley is a nationally rated Chess Master and onr of Canada`s leading coaches.

Poking fun at that "great race" of writers, it depicts a vogue that Hemingway himself refused to follow. In style and substance, <i>The Torrents of Spring</i> is a burlesque of Sherwood Anderson's <i>Dark Laughter,</i> but in the course of the narrative, other literary tendencies associated with American and British writers akin to Anderson -- such as D. H. Lawrence, James Joyce, and John Dos Passos -- come in for satirical comment. A highly entertaining story, <i>The Torrents of Spring</i> offers a rare glimpse into Hemingway's early career as a storyteller and stylist.</p><p>Ernest Hemingway did more to influence the style of English prose than any other writer of his time. Publication of&nbsp;<i>The Sun Also Rises</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>A Farewell to Arms</i>&nbsp;immediately established him as one of the greatest literary lights of the 20th century. His classic novella&nbsp;<i>The Old Man and the Sea&nbsp;</i>won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He died in 1961.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>Yogi Johnson stood looking out of the window of a big pump-factory in Michigan. Spring would soon be here. Could it be that what this writing fellow Hutchinson had said, "If winter comes can spring be far behind?" would be true again this year? Yogi Johnson wondered. Near Yogi at the next window but one stood Scripps O'Neil, a tall, lean man with a tall, lean face. Both stood and looked out at the empty yard of the pump-factory. Snow covered the crated pumps that would soon be shipped away. Once the spring should come and the snow melt, workmen from the factory would break out the pumps from piles where they were snowed in and haul them down to the G. R. &amp; 1. station, where they would be loaded on flat-cars and shipped away. Yogi Johnson looked out of the window at the snowed-in pumps, and his breath made little fairy tracings on the cold windowpane. Yogi Johnson thought of Paris. Perhaps it was the little fairy tracings that reminded him of the gay city where he had once spent two weeks. Two weeks that were to have been the happiest weeks of his life. That was all behind him now. That and everything else.<br><br>Scripps O'Neil had two wives. As he looked out of the window, standing tall and lean and resilient with his own tenuous hardness, he thought of both of them. One lived in Mancelona and the other lived in Petoskey. He had not seen the wife who lived in Mancelona since last spring. He looked out at the snow-covered pump-yards and thought what spring would mean. With his wife in Mancelona Scripps often got drunk. When he was drunk he and his wife were happy. They would go down together to the railway station and walk out along the tracks, and then sit together and drink and watch the trains go by. They would sit under a pine-tree on a little hill that overlooked the railway and drink. Sometimes they drank all night. Sometimes they drank for a week at a time. It did them good. It made Scripps strong.<br><br>Scripps had a daughter whom he playfully called Lousy O'Neil. Her real name was Lucy O'Neil. One night, after Scripps and his old woman had been out drinking on the railroad line for three or four days, he lost his wife. He didn't know where she was. When he came to himself everything was dark. He walked along the railroad track toward town. The ties were stiff and hard under his feet. He tried walking on the rails. He couldn't do it. He had the dope on that all right. He went back to walking along the ties. It was a long way into town. Finally he came to where he could see the lights of the switch-yard. He cut away from the tracks and passed the Mancelona High School. It was a yellow-brick building. There was nothing rococo about it, like the buildings he had seen in Paris. No, he had never been in Paris. That was not he. That was his friend Yogi Johnson.<br><br>Yogi Johnson looked out of the window. Soon it would be time to shut the pump-factory for the night. He opened the window carefully, just a crack. just a crack, but that was enough. Outside in the yard the snow had begun to melt. A warm breeze was blowing. A chinook wind the pump fellows called it. The warm chinook wind came in through the window into the pump-factory. All the workmen laid down their tools. Many of them were Indians.<br><br>The foreman was a short, iron-jawed man. He had once made a trip as far as Duluth. Duluth was far across the blue waters of the lake in the hills of Minnesota. A wonderful thing had happened to him there.<br><br>The foreman put his finger in his mouth to moisten it and held it up in the air. He felt the warm breeze on his finger. He shook his head ruefully and smiled at the men, a little grimly perhaps.<br><br>d"Well, it's a regular chinook, boys," he said.<br><br>Silently for the most part, the workmen hung up their tools. The half-completed pumps were put away in their racks. The workmen filed, some of them talking, others silent, a few muttering, to the washroom to wash up.<br><br>Outside through the window came the sound of an Indian war-whoop.<br><br>Copyright 1926 by Charles Scribner's Sons<br><br>Copyright renewed 1954 by Ernest Hemingway</p><h2>The Outlaw Demon Wails</h2><p><p>When you dance with demons, you lay your soul on the line . . .</p><p>In the Hollows, where the natural and the supernatural co-exist&#x2014;not always peacefully&#x2014;desperate times often call for unorthodox measures.

Using examples from theology, philosophy, art, literature, and popular culture, Russell describes the great changes effected in our idea of the Devil by the intellectual and cultural developments of modern times.</p></p><p>Jeffrey Burton Russell is Professor of History Emeritus at the University of California, Santa Barbara.<p>"Jeffrey Burton Russell is not only a conscientious historian, he is also an introspective essayist who acknowledges his own continuing struggle to understand the nature and the source of evil."</p> (Robert Coles <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br><p>"This book moves with sustained seriousness and brilliance across five centuries, from Luther's time to our own... and, although it has all the virtues of great intellectual history, it is explicitly rooted in a profound moral analysis of our own era."</p> (M.

Unlike many other treatments of the Holocaust, this history traces not only the persecution of the Jews, but also other segments of society victimized by the Nazis: Gypsies, homosexuals, Poles, Soviet POWs, the disabled, and other groups deemed undesirable. With clear and eloquent prose, Bergen explores the two interconnected goals that drove the Nazi German program of conquest and genocide&#x2015;purification of the so-called Aryan race and expansion of its living space&#x2015;and discusses how these goals affected the course of World War II. Including illustrations and firsthand accounts from perpetrators, victims, and eyewitnesses, the book is immediate, human, and eminently readable.</p><p><b>Doris L. Bergen</b> is Chancellor Rose and Ray Wolfe Professor of Holocaust Studies at the University of Toronto.Doris L. Bergen, professor of Holocaust Studies at the University of Toronto, has written perhaps the best concise history of the Holocaust published to date. She provides an accessible and comprehensive introduction to this complex subject. Writing with clarity and sensitivity, and based on the latest research, she places the Holocaust in its historical, cultural, social, and military contexts. The narrative is powerful and engaging, and the analysis is balanced and compelling. In this compact volume, fully illustrated with photographs and maps, Bergen covers all the major issues surrounding the Holocaust. She discusses not only the persecution of the Jews, but other groups victimized by the Nazis: Gypsies, the disabled, Poles, Soviet POWs, homosexuals, and political opponents of the regime. She also provides firsthand accounts from perpetrators, victims, and eyewitnesses thus adding the human dimension of the tragedy that is so often left out of other textbook treatments of the subject. The book is very readable, compelling and informative and highly recommended to expert and novice alike. (<i>Jewish Book World</i>)<br><br>A striking introduction to the complexity of Holocaust history&#x2014;precisely because despite being a very short book it does not in any way attempt to evade the complexity and context for Nazi violence against Jews. . . . It is an impressive introduction to the Holocaust which will certainly serve its readers well. (<i>Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal Of Jewish Studies</i>)<br><br>A meticulous, sensitive account of the Nazi race wars that combines a powerful narrative and explanatory drive at the same time as it illuminates individual lives and fates with searing precision. While giving full weight to the antisemitic core of Nazi racism, Bergen also shows why it claimed so many other groups of victims, and pursues it to its appalling climax in the wars of imperialist conquest and exploitation launched in 1939. This is a distinctive and remarkable achievement, as assured as it is readable.

This is her story, and that of Ormus Cama, the lover who finds, loses, seeks, and again finds her, over and over, throughout his own extraordinary life in music. Their epic romance is narrated by Ormus's childhood friend and Vina's sometime lover, her "back-door man," the photographer Rai, whose astonishing voice, filled with stories, images, myths, anger, wisdom, humor, and love, is perhaps the book's true hero. Telling the story of Ormus and Vina, he finds that he is also revealing his own truths: his human failings, his immortal longings. He is a man caught up in the loves and quarrels of the age's goddesses and gods, but dares to have ambitions of his own. And lives to tell the tale.</p><p>Around these three, the uncertain world itself is beginning to tremble and break. Cracks and tears have begun to appear in the fabric of the real. There are glimpses of abysses below the surfaces of things. <i>The Ground Beneath Her Feet</i> is Salman Rushdie's most gripping novel and his boldest imaginative act, a vision of our shaken, mutating times, an engagement with the whole of what is and what might be, an account of the intimate, flawed encounter between the East and the West, a brilliant remaking of the myth of Orpheus, a novel of high (and low) comedy, high (and low) passions, high (and low) culture. It is a tale of love, death, and rock 'n' roll.</p></p><p>The ground shifts repeatedly beneath the reader's feet during the course of Salman Rushdie's sixth novel, a riff on the Orpheus and Eurydice myth set in the high-octane world of rock &amp; roll. Readers get their first clues early on that the universe Rushdie is creating here is not quite the one we know: Jesse Aron Parker, for example, wrote "Heartbreak Hotel"; Carly Simon and Guinevere Garfunkel sang "Bridge over Troubled Water"; and Shirley Jones and Gordon McRae starred in "South Pacific." And as the novel progresses, Rushdie adds unmistakable elements of science fiction to his already patented magical realism, with occasionally uneven results. <p> Rushdie's cunning musician is Ormus Cana, the Bombay-born founder of the most popular group in the world. Ormus's Eurydice (and lead singer) is Vina Apsara, the daughter of a Greek American woman and an Indian father who abandoned the family. What these two share, besides amazing musical talent, is a decidedly twisted family life: Ormus's twin brother died at birth and communicates to him from "the other side"; his older brothers, also twins, are, respectively, brain-damaged and a serial killer. Vina, on the other hand, grew up in rural West Virginia where she returned home one day to find her stepfather and sisters shot to death and her mother hanging from a rafter in the barn. No wonder these two believe they were made for each other. </p><p> Narrated by Rai Merchant, a childhood friend of both Vina and Ormus, <i>The Ground Beneath Her Feet</i> begins with a terrible earthquake in 1989 that swallows Vina whole, then moves back in time to chronicle the tangled histories of all the main characters and a host of minor ones as well. Rushdie's canvas is huge, stretching from India to London to New York and beyond--and there's plenty of room for him to punctuate this epic tale with pointed commentary on his own situation: Muslim-born Rai, for example, remarks that "my parents gave me the gift of irreligion, of growing up without bothering to ask people what gods they held dear.... You may argue that the gift was a poisoned chalice, but even if so, that's a cup from which I'd happily drink again." Despite earthquakes, heartbreaks, and a rip in the time-space continuum, <i>The Ground Beneath Her Feet</i> may be the most optimistic, accessible novel Rushdie has yet written. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><p>"Dazzling--a wonderfully imagined and abundant novel about love and rock 'n' roll, about India and the United States, about gods and mortals, and about this crazy world we live in.-- Sheer joy." -M.G.

Rushdie's epic range has never been more impressive. Here is a great novelist operating as a master of metamorphosis -- transforming life, art and language in the subterranean maze of his imagination." -Don DeLillo</p> <br></p><h2>AIDS and Accusation: Haiti and the Geography of Blame, Updated with a New Preface</h2><p>Does the scientific &#x201c;theory&#x201d; that HIV came to North America from Haiti stem from underlying attitudes of racism and ethnocentrism in the United States rather than from hard evidence?

He encourages his readers to think for themselves, but he gives them a great deal of help in the way of background information, scholarly aids, and skillful dissection of competing interpretations. What stands out above all is the up-to-date scholarship and analytical acumen, the sensitivity to social context and the accessibility.

We know we need help, but we are afraid to let anyone--especially God--see how broken we truly are.<br> &nbsp;<br> In&nbsp;<i>Holy Desperation</i>, Heather King demonstrates that, when we're desperate, it's precisely the right time to cry out to God. King, a survivor of addiction and other forms of desperation, begins with the basics of how to pray when you're uncertain that God exists or when you feel that you're beyond God's reach. She challenges the assumptions that only the saintly can pray and that prayer ought to be tidy and nice. She reveals how prayer leads us beyond ourselves and into a life of purpose, lived for the good of others.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ultimately,&nbsp;<i>Holy Desperation</i>&nbsp;is an invitation to engage in bold, come-exactly-as-you-are prayer, offering a way forward, upward, and outward for anyone desperate enough to cry out for God's help and presence.

Rendered with freshness, intensity, and beauty as Barks alone can do, these startling and rich poems range from the "wholeness" one experiences with a true lover, to the grief of a lover's loss, and all the states in between: from the madness of sudden love to the shifting of a romance to deep friendship to the immersion in divine love. Rumi, the ultimate poet of love, explores all "the magnificent regions of the heart," and he opens you to the lover within.

Sixty-four specially equipped cruisers&#x2014;little more than planetary-bombardment weapons systems with a bit of starship wrapped around them&#x2014;flew in a suborbital, longitudinal formation. The sleek silver cruisers, their underbellies aglow in reflected destruction, struck Saes as unexpectedly beautiful. How strange that they could unleash annihilation in such warm, glorious colors.<br><br>Plasma beams shrieked from the bow of each cruiser and slammed into the arboreal surface of the moon, shimmering green umbilicals that wrote words of ruin across the surface and saturated the world in fire and pain. Dust and a swirl of thick black smoke churned in the atmosphere as the cruisers methodically vaporized large swaths of the moon&#x2019;s surface.<br><br>The bright light and black smoke of destruction filled Harbinger&#x2019;s viewscreen, drowning out the orange light of the system&#x2019;s star. Except for the occasional beep of a droid or a murmured word, the bridge crew sat in silence, their eyes fixed alternately on their instruments and the viewscreen. Background chatter on the many comm channels droned over the various speakers, a serene counterpoint to the chaos of the moon&#x2019;s death. Saes&#x2019;s keen olfactory sense caught a whiff of his human crew&#x2019;s sweat, spiced with the tang of adrenaline.<br><br>Watching the cruisers work, watching the moon die, Saes was reminded of the daelfruits he&#x2019;d enjoyed in his youth. He had spent many afternoons under the sun of his homeworld, peeling away the daelfruit&#x2019;s coarse, brown rind to get at the core of sweet, pale flesh.<br><br>Now he was peeling not a fruit but an entire moon.<br><br>The flesh under the rind of the moon&#x2019;s crust&#x2014;the Lignan they were mining&#x2014;would ensure a Sith victory in the battle for Kirrek and improve Saes&#x2019;s place in the Sith hierarchy. He would not challenge Shar Dakhon immediately, of course. He was still too new to the Sith Order for that.

Thirty-nine.&#x201d;<br><br>Saes nodded, turned his attention back to the viewscreen. The droid fell silent.<br><br>Despite Harbinger&#x2019;s distance from the surface, the Force carried back to Saes the terror of the pre-sentient primates that populated the moon&#x2019;s surface. Saes imagined the small creatures fleeing through the trees, screeching, relentlessly pursued by, and inevitably consumed in, fire. They numbered in the hundreds of thousands. Their fear caressed his mind, as faint, fleeting, and pleasing as morning fog.<br><br>His fellow Sith on Harbinger and Omen would be feeling the same thing as the genocide progressed to its inexorable conclusion. Perhaps even the Massassi aboard each ship would, in their dim way, perceive the ripples in the Force.<br><br>Long ago, when Saes had been a Jedi, before he had come to understand the dark side, such wholesale destruction of life might have struck him as wrong. He knew better now. There was no absolute right and wrong. There was only power. And those who wielded it defined right and wrong for themselves. That realization was the freedom offered by the dark side and the reason the Jedi would fall, first at Kirrek, then at Coruscant, then all over the galaxy.<br><br>&#x201c;Temperature in the wake?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>The science droid consulted the sensor data on its compscreen. &#x201c;Within the tolerance of the harvester droids.&#x201d;<br><br>Saes watched the cruisers slide through the atmosphere and light the moon on fire. He turned in his command chair to face his second in command, Los Dor. Dor&#x2019;s mottled, deep red skin looked nearly black in the dim light of the bridge. His yellow eyes mirrored the moon&#x2019;s fires. He never seemed to look up into Saes&#x2019;s eyes, instead focusing his gaze on the twin horns that jutted from the sides of Saes&#x2019;s jaw.<br><br>Saes knew Dor was as much a spy for Naga Sadow as he was an ostensible aide to himself. Among other things, Dor was there to ensure that Saes returned the Lignan&#x2014;all of the Lignan&#x2014;to Sadow&#x2019;s forces at Primus Goluud.<br><br>The tentacles on Dor&#x2019;s face quivered, and the cartilaginous ridges over his eyes rose in a question.<br><br>&#x201c;Give the order to launch the harvester droids, Colonel,&#x201d; Saes said to him. &#x201c;Harbinger&#x2019;s and Omen&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Captain,&#x201d; Dor responded.

The sight reminded Saes of a pyrotechnic display.<br><br>&#x201c;Harvester droids away,&#x201d; 8K6 intoned.<br><br>&#x201c;Stay with the droids and magnify,&#x201d; Saes said.<br><br>&#x201c;Copy,&#x201d; answered Dor, and nodded at the young human helmsman who controlled the viewscreen.<br><br>The harvester droids&#x2019; trajectories placed them tens of kilometers behind the destruction wrought by the mining cruisers. Most of them were lost to sight in the smoke, but the helmsman kept the viewscreen&#x2019;s perspective on a dozen or so that descended through a clear spot in the sky.<br><br>&#x201c;Attrition among the droids upon entry is negligible,&#x201d; said 8K6. &#x201c;Point zero three percent.&#x201d;<br><br>The helmsman further magnified the viewscreen again, then again.<br><br>Five kilos above the surface, the droids arrested their descent with thrusters, unfolded into their insectoid forms, and gently dropped to the charred, superheated surface. Anti-grav servos and platform pads on their six legs allowed them to walk on the smoking ruin without harm.<br><br>&#x201c;Give me a view from one of the droids.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Copy, sir,&#x201d; said Dor.<br><br>The helm worked his console, and half the viewscreen changed to a perspective of a droid&#x2019;s-eye view of the moon. A murmur ran through the bridge crew, an exhalation of awe. Even 8K6 looked up from the instrumentation.<br><br>The voice of Captain Korsin, commander of Harbinger&#x2019;s sister ship, Omen, broke through the comm chatter and boomed over the bridge speakers.<br><br>&#x201c;That is a sight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; Saes answered.<br><br>Smoke rose in wisps from the exposed subcrust. The heat of the plasma beams had turned the charred surface as hard and brittle as glass. Thick cracks and chasms lined the subcrust, veins through which only smoke and ash flowed. Waves of heat rose from the surface, distorting visibility and giving the moon an otherworldly, dream-like feel.<br><br>Hundreds of harvester droids dotted the surface, metal flies clinging to the moon&#x2019;s seared corpse. Walking in their awkward, insectoid manner, they arranged themselves into orderly rows, their high-pitched droidspeak mere chatter in the background.<br><br>&#x201c;Sensors activating,&#x201d; intoned 8K6.<br><br>As one, long metal proboscises extended from each of the droids&#x2019; faces. They ambled along in the wake of the destruction, waving their proboscises over the surface like dowsing rods, fishing the subsurface for the telltale molecular signature of Lignan.<br><br>Thinking of the Lignan, Saes licked his lips, tasted a faint flavor of phosphorous. He had handled a small Lignan crystal years before and still remembered the charge he had felt while holding it. His connection with that crystal had been the first sign of his affinity for the dark side.<br><br>The unusual molecular structure of Lignan attuned it to the dark side and enhanced a Sith&#x2019;s power when using the Force. The Sith had not been able to locate any significant deposits of the crystals in recent decades&#x2014;until now, until just before the battle for Kirrek. And it was Saes who had done it.<br><br>A few standard months ago, Naga Sadow had charged Saes with locating some deposits of the rare crystal for use in the war. It was a test, Saes knew. And Los Dor, his ostensible aide, was grading him. The Force had given Saes his answer, had brought him eventually, and at the last possible moment before the conflict began, to Phaegon III. The Force had used him as a tool to ensure Sith victory.<br><br>The realization warmed him. His scaled skin creaked as he adjusted his weight in his chair.<br><br>He would harvest enough Lignan from Phaegon III&#x2019;s moon to equip almost every Sith Lord and Massassi warrior preparing for the assault on Kirrek. If he&#x2019;d had more time, he could have mined the moon in a more methodical, less destructive fashion. But he did not have time, and Sadow would not tolerate delay.<br><br>So Saes had created his own right and wrong, and the primates and other life-forms on Phaegon III&#x2019;s moon had died for it.<br><br>He tapped his forefinger on his lightsaber hilt&#x2014;its curved form reminiscent of a claw&#x2014;impatient to see the results of the droids&#x2019; sensor scans. He leaned forward in his chair when an excited beep announced the first discovery of a Lignan signature. Another joined it. Another. He shared a look with Dor and could not tell from the fix of Dor&#x2019;s mouth, partially masked as it was by a beard of tentacles, if his colonel was pleased or displeased.<br><br>&#x201c;There it is, Saes,&#x201d; said Korsin from Omen. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve done it.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Quilting Answer Book: Solutions to Every Problem You&#39;ll Ever Face; Answers to Every Question You&#39;ll Ever Ask</h2><p>Whether you&#x2019;re perplexed about piecing, baffled by binding, or curious about cutting, Barbara Weiland Talbert has all your quilting quandaries covered.

When she's not thinking or writing, she can be found hanging with her kids.<p>Introduction<br><br>Dear Friend,</p><p>As you open this new journal of yours, the first thing I want to do is thank you for having the courage to think about your own life. The fact that you even picked this up should tell you that you're already on the path to a meaningful life. You wouldn't be reading these words if you weren't. So, bravo!</p><p>The truth is, no matter our age, no matter our background, we all could use some guidance, wisdom, and inspiration to help us live a life that is uniquely our own. My book <i>I've Been Thinking </i>. . . was my attempt to share with you my own thoughts about a meaningful life. I hoped in doing so that it would get you thinking about what you value. About what you believe in. About what's really important to you.<br> The response to the book was incredibly humbling, and along the way, many people asked if I would consider creating a journal where they could write their own thoughts as well. Well, voila! Here it is!</p><p>Writing has always been one of my most therapeutic tools. Time and again, it's helped me figure out what I'm thinking and feeling. It's also helped me get centered and get clear. In this journal, I wanted to give you the space and the encouragement to explore your own thoughts and feelings for yourself. I hope it helps you gain clarity and that it centers you on your path forward.</p><p>Throughout this journal, you'll find writing prompts inspired by the essays in <i>I've Been Thinking</i> . . . . There are inspirations for each week of the year. I've made this a weekly guide, because I myself sit down once a week to gather my thoughts and write.</p><p>My hope is that this journal will be a tool to help you make time each week to reflect on your life and write down what you've been thinking. You see, I believe that everyone is a writer, even if they don't think they are good at it. If you can think, then you can write. Your voice deserves to be heard as much as mine or anyone else's, so start using it here on these pages. (And if you need more inspiration, then pick up <i>I've Been Thinking</i> . . . , which has additional writing on all the topics covered here.)</p><p>In addition to providing space for you to respond to the writing prompts, I've also included additional space for you to reflect midweek and for you to write down your "yippee! moments" of the week as well. "Yippee! moments" are what I like to call any experience or encounter that made me smile or jump for joy. Sometimes those moments are big. Other times they're small. But trust me, even during our hardest weeks, there is something worth celebrating.</p><p>As with<i> I've Been Thinking </i>. . . , you can use this journal in whatever way suits you best. The essays are organized according to the seasons and holidays of the year, but feel free to jump around and respond to whatever inspires you in that moment. This is your journey and your journal. How you use it is up to you.</p><p>In addition to the weekly inspirations, you'll also find quotes and prayers to inspire you and make you think. In <i>I've Been Thinking</i> . . . , I wrote about how I use "Dear God" to start my prayers because those words reflect my faith and my beliefs. That said, I know that not everyone prays to the same God or uses that word. Some don't pray at all. That's why in this journal I've included my own prayers, and left space for you to write your own. That way you can fill in the blank however you'd like.</p><p>I've also included a "midyear check-in" within the pages of this journal. That's because I like to make a point of allotting time throughout the year to stop and take stock of how my life is going. Is my year going the way I expected it to go? If not, can I redirect myself to better serve my goals, hopes, and dreams? I like to ask myself these questions every few months so that I can evaluate where I am on the path of my life.</p><p>I'm so excited for you to start this process. I hope you'll dig deep in this journal, as I did when writing<i> I've Been Thinking</i> . . . . And, when you're done with your writing, I hope you'll be brave enough to share some of your words with others. That could just mean sharing an essay with someone you love. Or it could mean sharing it online with a community of other people seeking wisdom and inspiration. If you ever feel ready to share publicly, I invite you to visit my website at www.mariashriver.com/sundaypaper/ and submit your essay to my team. We'll consider publishing it in a future edition of The Sunday Paper newsletter, which is where all of the essays in my book <i>I've Been Thinking</i> . . . originated.</p><p>So, off you go. Turn the page now and get started. I wish you all the best on your personal journey to a meaningful life.</p><p>With love,<br>Maria</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every morning, I start my day with this version of Saint Teresa's prayer. I included it at the beginning of <i>I've Been Thinking</i> . . . , and I wanted to include it again in this journal because I really do believe it's a great way to start things out. I hope it helps you. Enjoy.</p><p>May today there be peace within</p><p>May you trust God that you are exactly</p><p>where you are meant to be</p><p>May you not forget the infinite</p><p>possibilities that are born of faith</p><p>Maybe you use those gifts that you have</p><p>received and pass on the love that has been</p><p>given to you</p><p>May you be content knowing that</p><p>you are a child of God</p><p>Let this presence settle into your bones</p><p>and allow your soul the freedom</p><p>to sing, dance, praise, and love</p><p>It is there for each and every one of us.</p><p>-Saint Teresa of Avila</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Week 1</p><p>What I'm Carrying with Me&nbsp;into the New Year</p><p>"I keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I used to spoil my copy-books; and I make so many beginnings there never will be an end."&nbsp;-Laurie, in <i>Little Women</i> by Louisa May Alcott</p><p>A new year is always thrilling because we have the chance to make it our best one yet. At the beginning of each year, I like to make a list of all the things I want to leave behind. I also like to make a list of the positive things in my life that I want to carry forward. I encourage you to try this same exercise. As you enter this new year, ask yourself: What do I want to bury from my past, and what do I want to bring with me into the future? Also ask yourself: How do I define a meaningful life, and how do I want it to look for me? What steps do I need to take today to begin this journey?</p><p>Dear God, living with regret and guilt for my past mistakes is a heavy burden to carry. Free me from the chains of remorse over things I've done that I wish I could do over. Please help me know in my heart that I can make a fresh start whenever I decide to. Free me to look ahead and not keep looking back.

Simultaneously silly and serious, Gauld adds an undeniable lightness to traditionally highbrow themes. From sarcastic panels about the health hazards of being a best-selling writer to a list of magical items for fantasy writers (such as the Amulet of Attraction, which summons mainstream acceptance, Hollywood money, and fresh coffee), Gauld&#x2019;s cartoons are timely and droll&#x2015;his trademark British humour, impeccable timing, and distinctive visual style sets him apart from the rest.</p><p>Lauded both for his frequent contributions to <i>New Scientist</i>, <i>The Guardian</i> and <i>The New York Times</i>, and his Eisner-nominated graphic novels, Tom Gauld is one of the most celebrated cartoonists working today.

Covering everything from Ghana's 550km of Atlantic coastline to its remote and sparsely populated northern border with Burkina Faso, this new edition has been thoroughly updated and is an ideal companion no matter what your interests are. Written by Philip Briggs, arguably the world's most experienced guidebook writer, it covers everything from inexpensive opportunities to see wildlife to cultural and historical aspects such as the slave trading posts. Background, practical and health information are complemented by a dedicated, illustrated chapter on wildlife, 63 maps and 18 chapters split across five regional sections, from Accra and surrounds to the coast, through eastern and central Ghana, right up to the north. The popular Cape Coast and the Ashanti regions are both covered, as is the increasingly high-profile Chale Wote Street Art festival.Friendly, safe and inexpensive, Ghana is an ideal destination for first-time visitors to Africa. It is rich in little-visited national parks, forest reserves, cultural sites and scenic waterfalls and blessed with bleached white beaches and the lush rainforest of the Atlantic coastline. Bradt's <em>Ghana</em> is accompanied by a dedicated, updated website run by the author himself and caters for everyone from birdwatchers to bar-hoppers. Whether you want to cruise the world's largest man-made reservoir, Lake Volta, on a pokey old steamer, hike with elephants in Mole National Park, or party all night in Accra's glittering Osu district, Bradt's <em>Ghana</em> is an indispensable companion.<br><br></p><p>Philip Briggs has been exploring Africa since 1986. He has visited more than two dozen African countries and written about most of them for specialist travel and wildlife magazines including <em>Africa Birds &amp; Birding</em>, <em>Africa Geographic</em>, BBC <em>Wildlife</em>, <em>Travel Africa</em> and <em>Wanderlust</em>. His long relationship with Ghana started in 1997, when he researched the first edition of a Bradt guide to the country that is soon to go into its 7th edition. Philip has returned to West Africa regularly since then to update the Bradt Guide to Ghana and to explore neighbouring countries such as Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal and Gambia. He still spends at least four months on the road every year, usually accompanied by his wife, the travel photographer Ariadne Van Zandbergen, and spends his rest of the time battering away at a keyboard in the sleepy South African coastal village of Wilderness.This edition has been updated by Nancy Chuang. From peaceful fishing villages to the country's busiest festivals, she is fully immersed in all aspects of Ghana. Her cultural education has covered jollof and waakye, highlife and reggae, expat bars and chop bars. From the back of a motorbike or the backseat of a trotro, she dives deep into conversations about solo women travellers and how &#x2018;real Americans' are supposed to look. After multiple visits around Africa, she sees Ghana as one of the friendliest, liveliest, and quirkiest countries on the continent. Nancy is physically based in Brooklyn where her commute unfortunately doesn't involve canoeing through Ghana's mangroves.A great travelling companion., <i>Director Magazine</i></p><h2>Race Car Vehicle Dynamics</h2><p>This is a very informative book for anyone who is a car racing enthusiast and likes to keep apprised on the high performance of their trophy car.</p><p>We offer no apologies for making this important... book our choice for the second time around.

The authors have closely monitored the evolution of procedure over this time, and adapted the basic structure of the book to take account of those changes.<br><br>That evolution remains central to the seventh edition. The new edition retains the basic structure of the book, and a great deal of the existing superstructure of principal cases. It adds substantially revised text and note material to present contemporary issues in the context of those cases or new principal cases. The discovery chapter, for example, is infused with coverage of the 2015 rule amendments that have received so much attention. The personal jurisdiction chapter integrates the many recent Supreme Court decisions into the existing framework, conveying the developments that have occurred since the last edition appeared in 2013.<br><br>The new edition also offers new principal cases to examine and illustrate a number of issues. A new Rule 19 case on required parties presents the contemporary issues in a setting likely to be interesting to many students. A new Internet jurisdiction case involves online payday lending, an example of the fast-moving world of Internet-based commerce. A recent supplemental jurisdiction case enables students to work through the application of � 1367 in a setting that also involves appreciation of various joinder concepts. A new class-action case presents the challenges of consumer class actions. New Supreme Court and other principal cases address issues of subject matter jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction.

Deductive profiling is different from other forms of profiling in that it does not involve averaged, statistical profiles. Instead it focuses on criminal profiling as an investigative process, solving real crime through an honest understanding of the nature and behavior of criminals. It approaches each criminal incident as its own universe of behaviors and relationships. Throughout the text, the author illustrates the most crucial tenet that any good criminal profiler should adhere to: the enthusiastic desire to investigate and examine the facts. <i>Criminal Profiling</i> is an ideal companion for students and professionals alike, including investigators, forensic scientists, criminologists, mental health professionals, and attorneys. Readers will use it as a comprehensive reference text, a handbook for evaluating physical evidence, a tool to bring new perspectives to cold cases, and as an aid in preparing for criminal trials. </p> <b>New Features</b><br> <ul> <li>New cases in every chapter</li> <li>New chapters in logic and reasoning</li> <li>New chapter reviewing non-evidence based profiling methods</li> <li>New chapter on mass homicide</li> <li>New chapter on terrorist profiling and interviewing</li> </ul> <b>Additional Features</b><br> <ul> <li>Best-selling author Brent Turvey defines the deductive profiling method, which focuses on examining the nature and behavior of criminals in order to solve crimes.</li> <li>Contributing authors represent law enforcement, academic, mental health, and forensic science communities for a balanced perspective.</li> <li>Completely revised with 35% new material including updates on the latest advances in evidence-based profiling.</li> </ul> <b>Excepts from <i>Criminal Profiling</i></b><br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <i>Case Example: Blackmail</i><br> <p>In an extortion case, the offender sent a message to the victim from a Web-based e-mail account.

He has had national media exposure for his dynamic fusion of Eastern insight and Bible study, having been the subject of stories on ABC News, the &#34;McNeil Lehrer News Hour, and various NPR programs.- In the past five years there have been national conferences on Jewish meditation in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Miami where Lew has been a featured speaker.</p><p>Alan Lew is the rabbi of Congregation Beth Sholom in San Francisco and is at the forefront of the movement to develop new forms of Jewish spiritual expression. His work in the area of using Zen meditation to enhance Jewish spirituality has been highlighted on programs such as ABC News, The MacNeil-Lehrer Report, the PBS news magazine Religion and Ethics Newsweekly, and National Public Radio&#39;s All Things Considered. He also serves as moderator of Mosaic, CBS&#39;s weekly religious talk show. Lew explores meditation in Jewish contexts, and has conducted workshops and retreats on Jewish meditation throughout the United States and Canada.Once again Rabbi Lew (<i>One God Clapping</i>; <i>This Is Real and You Are Completely Unprepared</i>) beautifully marries the ancient traditions, history and lore of the Torah and Talmud with the serene meditative practices of Zen Buddhism. His singular distinction of founding and leading a meditation center, Makor Or (in San Francisco), the first of its kind connected to a Conservative synagogue, gives him a unique perspective. He says that Jews have had the written treasures, rich discussions and the sacred Sabbath right in front of them for 3,000 years, but have often overlooked them. Using selected Torah passages, Talmudic musings and contemporary stories of friends and congregants, Lew illustrates the intrinsic spiritual path within Judaism and suggests ways to incorporate that path into an everyday spiritual practice. Like any good teacher unafraid to address big, broad issues&#x2014;suffering, fear, conflict&#x2014;and agile enough to make sense of the more elusive ones&#x2014;listening for and finding God, connecting to and appreciating sacred emptiness&#x2014;Lew follows each lesson with a summation of "practice points." Seekers need not be Jewish to engage the ancient wisdom of these meditations that offer a rich, multileveled path to everyday spirituality.<i> (Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Krishnamurti suggests that "true relationship" can come into being only when there is self-knowledge of the conditions which divide and islolate individuals and groups. Only by renouncing the self can we understand the problem of lonliness, and truly love.</p></p><p><p>J. Krishnamurti (1895-1986) was a renowned spiritual teacher whose lectures and writings have inspired thousands.

Online dating, social media, internet pornography, and the phenomenon of the smartphone generation have created an avalanche of change with far-reaching consequences for sexuality today. The church has struggled to address this new moral ecology because it has focused on clarity of belief rather than quality of formation. The real challenge for spiritual formation lies in addressing the underlying moral intuitions we carry subconsciously, which are shaped by the convictions of our age.<br><br>In this book, a fresh new voice offers a persuasive Christian vision of sex and relationships, calling young adults to faithful discipleship in a hypersexualized world. Drawing from his pastoral experience with young people and from cutting-edge research across multiple disciplines, Jonathan Grant helps Christian leaders understand the cultural forces that make the church's teaching on sex and relationships ineffective in the lives of today's young adults. He also sets forth pastoral strategies for addressing the underlying fault lines in modern sexuality.</p><p><b>Faithful Discipleship in a Hypersexualized World<br></b><br>"There are few issues in life that confront each of us like human sexuality. Every person struggles with making sense of relationships, <i>eros</i>, and longings, emotional as well as physical. Every man and woman wrestles with the lies of sensualized culture while holding at bay the effects of pervasive isolation and intense loneliness. In <i>Divine Sex </i>Jonathan Grant guides us through this journey with wit, grace, and honesty while being both wholly theological and profoundly real."<br>--<b>Chap Clark</b>, senior pastor, St. Andrews Presbyterian Church, Newport Beach, California<br><br>"An exceptionally important and timely book. The gap between what passes for sexual and relational wisdom in contemporary culture and what actually makes for genuine human fulfillment has opened up so quickly and grown so wide that the lives of an entire generation are sliding headlong into frustration and despair. Grant addresses the issues directly yet sympathetically, countering contemporary folly with solid data, biblical wisdom, and grace. I wish it could be made mandatory reading for the entire millennial generation."<br>--<b>Craig M. Gay</b>, Regent College, Vancouver<br><br>"Grant compassionately exposes the powerful influences that orient us away from the heart of the Christian story by disordering our desires, explores the Christian reality of our shared life as sexual human beings in communion, and encourages us toward practices that embody the wholeness of cruciform life together--and he does so with candor, wisdom, and hope."<br>--<b>Cherith Nordling</b>, Northern Seminary<br><br>"In the intensely sexualized culture of the secularized West, Grant's thoughtful treatment is a valuable contribution to our understanding not just of our cultural conditioning but of God's design and the true sexual liberation we can experience as followers of Jesus."<br>--<b>Sam Metcalf</b>, CRM-US, Fullerton, California<br><br>"This is a book that needed to be written.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Absorbing Grant's insight, analysis, and constructive argument should not only deepen how we are talking about sex and discipleship; it should also give us new intentionality about the church as a formative community, enabling us to live into a different script that is good news--that our sexual lives are hidden with Christ in God."<br>--<b>James K.

Now updated to include the fall of Slobodan Milosevic, the capture of all indicted war criminals from the Yugoslav wars, and each state's quest for legitimacy in the European Union, <i>The Balkans</i> explores the often catastrophic relationship between the Balkans and the Great Powers, raising some disturbing questions about Western intervention.</p><p></p></p><p><b>Misha Glenny</b> was born in 1958 and educated at Bristol Universty and Charles University in Prague.

Watson</h2><p>From the gritty streets of nineteenth century London, the loyal and courageous Dr. Watson offers a tale unearthed after generations of lore: the harrowing story of Sherlock Holmes&#x2019;s attempt to hunt down Jack the Ripper.<br><br>As England&#x2019;s greatest specialist in criminal detection, Sherlock Holmes is unwavering in his quest to capture the killer responsible for terrifying London&#x2019;s East End. He hires an &#x201c;unfortunate&#x201d; known as Mary Ann Monk, the friend of a fellow streetwalker who was one of the Ripper&#x2019;s earliest victims; and he relies heavily on the steadfast and devoted Dr. John H. Watson. When Holmes himself is wounded in Whitechapel during an attempt to catch the savage monster, the popular press launches an investigation of its own, questioning the great detective&#x2019;s role in the very crimes he is so fervently struggling to prevent. Stripped of his credibility, Holmes is left with no choice but to break every rule in the desperate race to find the madman known as &#x201c;the Knife&#x201d; before it is too late.<br> <br>A masterly re-creation of history&#x2019;s most diabolical villain, Lyndsay Faye&#x2019;s debut brings unparalleled authenticity to the atmosphere of Whitechapel and London in the fledgling days of tabloid journalism and recalls the ideals evinced by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x2019;s most beloved and world-renowned characters. Jack the Ripper&#x2019;s identity, still hotly debated around the world more than a century after his crimes were committed, remains a mystery ripe for speculation. Dust and Shadow explores the terrifying prospect of tracking a serial killer without the advantage of modern forensics, and the result is a lightning-paced novel brimming with historical detail that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p><p>Lyndsay Faye is a writer and actress&nbsp;who lives in New York with her husband and cat.&nbsp;<b>Chapter One</b><p><b></b></p><b>Two Crimes</b><p>It has been argued by those who have so far flattered my attempts to chronicle the life and career of Mr. Sherlock Holmesas to approach them in a scholarly manner that I have often been remiss in the arena of precise chronology. While nodding to kindly meant excuses made for me in regards to hasty handwriting or careless literary agents, I must begin by confessing that my errors, however egregious, were entirely intentional. Holmes' s insistence, not to mention my own natural discretion, often prevented me from maintaining that exactitude so highly prized in a biographer; I have been forced to change the dates of marginal cases to disguise great ones, alter names and circumstances, all the while diligently preserving the core truth of the events, without which there would have been no object in writing anything at all. In this instance, however, any obfuscation would be absurd, as the facts are known not only to the people of London but to the world. I shall therefore set down the entire truth, as it happened to Holmesand to myself, omitting nothing that pertains to the most harrowing series of crimes my illustrious friend and I were ever called upon to solve.</p><p>The year of 1888 had already proven significant for Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for it was in that twelvemonth that he performed valuable services for one of the reigning houses of Europe and continued forestalling the activities of Professor James Moriarty, whose hold over London's underworld grew ever more apparent to my friend. Several highly publicized investigations that year displayed Holmes' s remarkable skills to the public, including the appalling affair of the faulty oil lamp, and the matter of Mrs. Victoria Mendosa's mysteriously vanishing thimble and its consequences. My friend's talents, which had once languished in obscure specialism, in that year flamed into the most gratifying notoriety.</p><p>Despite the busyness that accompanied Holmes's ever-increasing reputation for omniscience, we found ourselves at home on that evening in early August, the day after Bank Holiday, Holmesperforming chemical analyses of an American snake venom which had recently proven itself a nearly untraceable poison, and I engaged in a perusal of the day's papers. To my delight, the skies above the buildings burned with that most elusive of all elements, the London sun, and a brisk breeze fluttered about the windows (one of which I'd opened as a safeguard against Holmes' s chemical efforts), when an item in the late edition of the <i>Star</i> caught my eye.</p><p>"I cannot begin to understand," I said to no one in particular, "what could drive a murderer to such total desecration of the human body."</p><p>Holmes, without looking up from his work, remarked, "An argument could be made that the ultimate desecration of the human body is to end its earthly usefulness, which would imply that all murderers share equally that specific charge."</p><p>"This is rather beyond the pale. It states here that some poor woman, as yet unidentified, was found stabbed to death in Whitechapel."</p><p>"A deplorable, though hardly baffling occurrence. I imagine that she worked the area for food, drink, and daily shelter. Such pitiable unfortunates are particularly likely to inspire crimes of passion in the men with whom they associate."</p><p>"She was stabbed twenty times, Holmes."</p><p>"And your unassailable medical assessment is that once would have been enough."</p><p>"Well, yes," I faltered. "Apparently the villain continued to slash at her long after she was dead, or so the pattern of blood indicates." </p><p>The detective smiled. "You are a gentleman of the most sympathetic character, my dear Watson. While you would possibly -- for I have seen you do it -- condone a crime of passion committed in the throes of despair or of vengeance, you can see nothing permissible about such morbid abuse."</p><p>"I suppose that expresses it."</p><p>"I confess I cannot imagine myself in such a rage as to batter my victim beyond all sense either," he admitted. "Is there anything further?" </p><p>"The police know nothing yet."</p><p>Holmes sighed and pushed aside his scientific materials. "Would you and I had the power to make all of London safe, my good man, but for the moment, let us leave our musings upon the depths to which our fellow citizens can sink and instead explore whether or not we have time to make a seven-thirty curtain for Brahms's Symphony No. 4 in E Minor at the Royal Albert Hall. My attention was directed to the second-chair cellist by my brother Mycroft, and I should be grateful for your company while I observe the gentleman in his natural habitat."</p><p>It took Sherlock Holmesexactlyfive days to complete the affair ofthe second cellist, and once concluded, my friend had the thanks ofthe premier branches of the British government, of which his brotherMycroft was a pivotal member. My own knowledge of MycroftHolmes's exalted occupation was at that time a closely kept secret, for he occasionally engaged his brother upon nationally vital inquiries about which neither Sherlock Holmes nor I ought to have had the slightest inkling. I regret to say, however, that when nothing but the most pedestrian of wrongdoing took place in the following weeks, my friend lapsed into that melancholy torpor which made my own life, not to mention that of our landlady, Mrs. Hudson, taxing in the extreme. Holmesever maintained the opinion that we should abandon him entirely when such a fit was upon him, but as a medical man, I dreaded the sight of his tiny, impeccably kept hypodermic syringe and that momentous stop at the chemist's which promised that my friend would commence to ruin himself for a matter of days or weeks if I did not take any steps to circumvent him. In vain I scanned the papers, and in vain I attempted to convince Holmesthat a woman ought not to be stabbed so very many times, Whitechapel or no. At length I found myself longing, fleetingly and against the dictates of my conscience, for the advent of some sensational misfortune.</p><p>I rose early that fateful Saturday, the morning of September the first, and as I sat smoking a pipe after breakfast, Holmes strode into the sitting room, fully dressed and in the process of reading the <i>Daily News</i>. The warmth of his pale complexion announced he had been out, and I noted with relief that his keen gaze betrayed no glimmer of the drug I had come to despise. His chiseled brow furrowed in concentration, he laid the open paper on our dining table and within moments had opened seven or eight other editions to which we subscribed, quickly locating the same story in each and then draping the paper over an article of furniture.</p><p>"Good morning, Holmes," I remarked, just as our sitting room seemed in danger of disappearing under the crackling storm of newsprint.</p><p>"I've been out," he replied.</p><p>"Yes," I returned dryly.</p><p>"I hope you have already broken your fast this morning, Watson."</p><p>"Whatever do you mean?"</p><p>"It appears that the defilement of corpses is a growing industry in Whitechapel. They've found another one, my dear fellow. Abdomen apparently slashed after she was murdered."</p><p>"What was the cause of death, then?"</p><p>"Her neck was nearly severed."</p><p>"Good heavens. Where was she found?"</p><p>"In Buck's Row, it seems, which arrested my interest immediately. I imagined the other matter a bizarre aberration, but here is another on its heels."</p><p>"The first was bad enough."</p><p>"That girl's name was Martha Tabram, and the early report had it wrong: she was stabbed a grand total of thirty-nine times," he stated dispassionately. "Yesterday morning's victim, whose name was apparently Mary Ann Nichols, by all accounts was partially eviscerated."</p><p>"Dare I hope you shall look into the matter?" I asked.</p><p>"It is hardly within my purview to do so when no one has consul -- "</p><p>At that moment, Mrs. Hudson entered and surveyed our newly adorned furnishings with silent cynicism. Our landlady was not in the best of spirits, for Holmes in his devil-may-care humour had used the berry spoon to dissolve chemical elements over his burner, and the disagreement this activity had caused had not yet resolved itself to her satisfaction.</p><p>"Gentlemen to see you," she said from the doorway. "Inspector Lestrade and one other. Will you be requiring aught from my cupboards, Mr. Holmes, or have you everything you need?"</p><p>"Ha!" Holmes exclaimed. "Lestrade occasionally evinces the most impeccable timing. Indeed no, Mrs. Hudson, I've sufficient cutlery for my purposes. I shall ring if I want anything in the way of a pickle fork. Do show up the inspector, if you will."</p><p>With studied dignity, Mrs. Hudson exited. A few moments later Inspector Lestrade and an associate entered the room. Holmesoften had occasion to bemoan the intellect of our hatchet-visaged friend, the lean and dapper little inspector, but Lestrade's diligence commanded our respect even when his utter lack of imagination strained the independent investigator's nerves. On this occasion, Lestrade looked as rumpled and anxious as I had ever seen him. His companion was dressed in dark tweeds, his beard modestly trimmed beneath a more impressive moustache; he had a pale, retiring aspect, and his eyes darted shyly between Holmesand myself.</p><p>My friend took them in at a glance.

With humility and deep religious conviction, the famous Catholic novelist Louis de Wohl takes us into the mind and heart of this great missionary and saint who went by order of St. Ignatius of Loyola to &#34;set all afire&#34; in the Orient. Louis de Wohl captivates the reader as he follows Xavier&#39;s life from student days in Paris, through his meeting with Ignatius, his rather reluctant conversion, and his travels as one of the first Jesuits. The story takes the reader from Europe to Goa, India, Malaysia, Japan, and finally, to an island off the coast of China, where the exiled Xavier dies virtually alone. The book captures the dramatic struggles and inspiring zeal of this remarkable saint, giving at the same time an enthralling picture of the age in which he lived.</p><p>Louis de Wohl wrote numerous historical novels for adults, including &#34;The Living Wood&#34;, which is also about St. Helena and Constantine. He earned international acclaim for The Spear, and among his other popular titles are &#34;Lay Siege to Heaven, The Restless Flame, The Joyful Beggar &#34;and &#34;The Quiet Light.&#34;<p>"... written with fine understanding ... Xavier's generosity speaks to every age, and seldom so clearly and compellingly as in this book."</p><p> --</p><p><strong>New York Times Book Review</strong></p><br><br><p>"Francis Xavier took the admonition to go to all nations seriously. His life remains one of the lessons of what it means to leave all to follow Christ, that nothing else profits a man but this. De Wohl's novel brings the drama of Xavier alive again to a point where we can begin to catch the flavor of Xavier's zeal and drama."</p><p> --</p><p><strong>James V.

The law was enforced mercilessly and sometimes violently in the resoundingly successful effort to totally disenfranchise these earliest American settlers.</p><p>N. Brent Kennedy, founder of the Melungeon Research Committee, is a native of Appalachia and a Melungeon. One day he began explaining to his parents their heritage and thus unraveled family mysteries that go back for generations. After years wondering about the mysterious dark-skinned people he had often encountered while growing up, he realized that he was indeed one of them, that his family was part of the proud, troubled heritage of the Melungeons. He earned degrees from Clinch Valley College of the University of Virginia and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.As Alex Haley's book Roots encouraged African-Americans to search for their African history through family stories and "myths," Kennedy's own search for identity through family history has encouraged a population of mixed-race people to search for their origins. This has led to the recovery of lost pride and a new self-identity. The book has also forced academics to admit their long history of denial of the diversity of American people and to recognize the multicultural composition of the American population. -- <i>Helen M. Lewis, Retired Professor of Sociology and Appalachian Studies</i><br><br>Brent Kennedy is the prime mover behind the recent, and astonishing, revival of Melungeon identity. His determination to uncover and to understand his heritage makes for a fascinating story, which is still in the process of unfolding. But this is the book that started it all. -- <i>John Shelton Reed, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill</i><br><br>For fifty years, since I first heard the word "Melungeon" and visited their home-sties in the hills of Tennessee, I have been intrigued by the history, and mystery, of my distinctive neighbors. Plagued by two centuries of rumor, superstition, and deliberate misinformation about their origin and character, they were third-class citizens in an Appalachia already burdened by second-class stereotypes. <p>How welcome then is Brent Kennedy's scholarly and wide-ranging search for the truth behind the Melungeons' origin. It is a fascinating work carrying an implicit reminder of the worth and pride of every human being. -- <i>Wilma Dykeman, Tennessee State Historian and author of The Tall Woman, Tennessee: A Bicentennial History, and The French Broad</i></p></p><h2>Character Disturbance: the phenomenon of our age (Volume 1)</h2><p><p>Modern permissiveness and the new culture of entitlement allows disturbed people to reach adulthood without proper socialization.

All the series&#39; volumes have been developed in accordance with performance-based principles and methodology--contextualization, learner-centeredness, use of authentic materials, usage-orientedness, balance between skill getting and skill using, and integration of speaking, listening, reading, writing, and culture. Grammar points are systematically introduced in simple but adequate explanations and abundant examples and exercises. Each situation/topic-based lesson of the main texts consists of model dialogues, narration, new words and expressions, vocabulary notes, culture, grammar, usage, and English translation of dialogues. In response to comments from hundreds of students and instructors of the first edition, this new edition features a more attractive two-colour design with all new photos and drawings and additional exercises that focus on vocabulary and grammar. Lessons are now organised into two main sections, each containing a conversational text (with its own vocabulary list) and a reading passage. The accompanying workbook, newly written, provides students with extensive skill-using activities based on the skills learned in the main text. Integrated Korean is a project of the Korean Language Education and Research Center (KLEAR) with the support of the Korea Foundation.

What&#x2019;s keeping his memory from being obliterated is not the law. It is the grit and guts of his mother, who refuses to surrender her son to fate, and the tenacity of his brother, a blogger, who fuses tradition and technology to explore and explode the void in which Mehdi has vanished. <p></p><i>Zahra&#x2019;s Paradise </i>weaves together fiction and real people and events. As the world witnessed the aftermath of Iran&#x2019;s fraudulent elections, through YouTube videos, on Twitter, and in blogs, this story came into being. The global response to this gripping tale has been passionate&#x2014;an echo of the global outcry during the political upheaval of the summer of 2009. &nbsp;<i>Zahra&#x2019;s Paradise </i>is a first on the internet, a first for graphic novels, and a first in the history of political dissidence. <i>Zahra&#x2019;s Paradise </i>is being serialized online at zahrasparadise.com. <br><br><b>Q and A with the Author of <i>Zahra's Paradise</i>, Amir</b><br> <p><b>Q: What was your inspiration for this story?</b></p> <p>A: Over the past thirty years, thousands of Iranians have had to bury their loved ones prematurely in Zahra&#x2019;s Paradise, a vast cemetery on the outskirts of Tehran. Thousands of monarchists, nationalists, leftists, communists, reformists, fundamentalists have all been killed in the name of one ideology, party or another, and they all end up buried in Zahra&#x2019;s Paradise. In a way, the cemetery is where the heavens touch the earth. And what a sad and sorry spectacle that is--a zone of trauma and death, grief and sorrow that afflicts everyone.</p> <p><b>Q: Tell us a little about how the events in <i>Zahra&#x2019;s Paradise</i> tie in with the 2009 elections in Iran.</b></p> <p>A: During the protests of the 2009 elections, even at the time of burial inside Zahra&#x2019;s Paradise, that script was being challenged and broken. Time and time again, Zahra&#x2019;s Paradise became a stage, not for burying the dead, but for witnessing life. And it was Iranian women, and men, who were saying: no, we refuse to see our land, our names, our constitution, and our Iran turned into a womb for burying the corpse of our children, for burying violence, for burying lies, for burying Iran&#x2019;s son and daughters. They are the guardians of another Iran, and it is the sons and daughters of that Iran that <i>Zahra&#x2019;s Paradise</i> celebrates. </p> <p><b>Q: Tell us a little bit about your own personal and emotional connections to this story.</b></p> <p>A: I was twelve years old when the Iranian revolution happened. We&#x2019;re talking 1979. As a kid, I saw an entire world collapse. I had to leave Iran, but I could never let go of the Iranian people. They were what made my childhood so beautiful, so full of joy and tenderness. But how do you hold onto those emotions--that sacred ground--from exile? You keep your world alive in your imagination. That&#x2019;s what millions of Iranians inside and outside Iran have done and are doing.</p> <p>It was hard to suddenly see that world, Iran, vanish behind stereotypes of Iranians as terrorists, fundamentalists and extremists. That was not my Iran. I did not recognize it then, and I do not recognize it now. Fast forward thirty years, to the protests of 2009, and all of a sudden, that Iran, a beautiful, gentle, powerful, exquisite Iran, an Iran that so many had declared dead and buried as lost, suddenly bursts through. And so like millions of people around the world, people all over the Arab world and the Middle East, we absorbed their energy, felt their spark, and joined our strength and our dreams to theirs. It was impossible not to feel a connection.</p> <p> <strong>A Look Inside <i>Zahra's Paradise</i></strong> <br>Click below to view full-sized illustrations. </p><p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody></table><b>Amir </b>is an Iranian-American human rights activist, journalist and documentary filmmaker.

Sometimes, it&#x2019;s more like a punch: the death of a loved one, a serious illness, a divorce, the loss of a job, a freak accident, or a shocking betrayal. Sometimes it&#x2019;s a little gentler. Envy, loneliness, resentment, failure, disappointment, and rejection can sting just as much. But whatever form your reality slap takes, one thing&#x2019;s for sure&#x2014;it hurts! And most of us don&#x2019;t deal with the pain very well.</p> <p><em>The Reality Slap</em> offers a four-part path for healing from crises based on acceptance and commitment therapy.

Taken as aspirational, four of those myths remind us of our noblest ideals, challenging us to realize our nation's promise while galvanizing the sense of hope and unity we need to reach our goals. Misused, these myths allow for illusions of innocence that fly in the face of white supremacy, the primal American myth that stands at the heart of all the others.</p></p><p>Richard Hughes is Distinguished Professor Emeritus at both Pepperdine University and Messiah College. He is the author, coauthor, or editor of more than a dozen books including Illusions of Innocence: Protestant Primitivism in America, 1630-1875 and Christian America and the Kingdom of God."It takes a whole lot of courage for white theologians and scholars to speak the truth about race. If we had more white theologians and religion scholars like Hughes who would break their silence about white supremacy and face it for what it is, we--together--could make a better world." -- James H. Cone, author of<i> The Cross and the Lynching Tree</i><br><br> "The American national story is a myth, built on a series of myths that Richard Hughes reveals in this critical book. Myths America Lives By is a book we all need in order to understand ourselves, to understand our nation, to understand White supremacy."--Ibram X. Kendi, National Book Award-winning author of Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America<br><br>"Richard Hughes' Myths America Lives By was already required reading when it was released back in the pre-Trump era. With this update of his lacerating critique of the sordidness of American civil religion and other destructive myths, Hughes now indicts white supremacy as the foundational myth providing the most accelerant to those other myths that have burned through our history. Richard Hughes thinks hard and listens even harder to the historians, the scholars and, most of all, the prophets who understood the malignancy of white supremacy long before he did. The result is Myths America Lives By: White Supremacy and the Stories that Gives Us Meaning. Once again, Hughes' willingness to tell the truth about the myths we live by has put us all in his debt".--Tony Norman, columnist, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette<br><br> "For those of us who struggle to understand the racially charged polarities of today as well as the highs and lows of our American past, this book paints a heartbreaking, damning, and intimately clear picture." --<i>Christian Chronicle</i><br> &nbsp;<br><br>"<i>Myths America Lives By</i> is an essential read for those interested in shattering the cycle of racism and imaging a new way forward.

She shows how a deeper engagement with history, both as individuals and in the sphere of public debate, can help us understand ourselves and the world better. But she also warns that history can be misused and lead to misunderstanding. History is used to justify religious movements and political campaigns alike. Dictators may suppress history because it undermines their ideas, agendas, or claims to absolute authority. Nationalists may tell false, one-sided, or misleading stories about the past. Political leaders might mobilize their people by telling lies. It is imperative that we have an understanding of the past and avoid these and other common traps in thinking to which many fall prey. This brilliantly reasoned work, alive with incident and figures both great and infamous, will compel us to examine history anew&#x2014;and skillfully illuminates why it is important to treat the past with care.</p><p>Margaret MacMillan is the author of <b>Paris 1919</b>, <b>Nixon and Mao</b><i>, </i>and <b>Women of the Raj.</b><i> </i>Paris 1919 won the Duff Cooper Prize, the Samuel Johnson Prize for nonfiction, the Hessell-Tiltman Prize for History, a Silver Medal for the Arthur Ross Book Award of the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Governor-General&#x2019;s prize for nonfiction, and it was selected by the editors of <i>The New York Times</i> as one of the ten best books of the year. A past provost of Trinity College at the University of Toronto, MacMillan is the warden of St. Antony&#x2019;s College at Oxford University.<i>Chapter One<br>The History Craze</i><br><br>History, and not necessarily the sort that professional historians are doing, is widely popular these days, even in North America, where we have tended to look toward the future rather than the past. It can be partly explained by market forces. People are better educated and, particularly in the mature economies, have more leisure time and are retiring from work earlier. Not everyone wants to retire to a compound in the sun and ride adult tricycles for amusement. History can be helpful in making sense of the world we live in. It can also be fascinating, even fun. How can even the best novelist or playwright invent someone like Augustus Caesar or Catherine the Great, Galileo or Florence Nightingale? How can screenwriters create better action stories or human dramas than exist, thousand upon thousand, throughout the many centuries of recorded history? There is a thirst out there both for knowledge and to be entertained, and the market has responded with enthusiasm.<br><br>Museums and art galleries mount huge shows around historical characters like Peter the Great or on specific periods in history. Around the world, new museums open every year to commemorate moments, often grim ones, from the past. China has museums devoted to Japanese atrocities committed during World War II. Washington, Jerusalem, and Montreal have Holocaust museums. Television has channels devoted entirely to history (often, it must be said, showing a past that seems to be made up largely of battles and the biographies of generals); historic sites are wilting under the tramp of tourists; history movies&#x2014;think of all the recent ones on Queen Elizabeth I alone&#x2014;are making money; and the proliferation of popular histories shows that publishers have a good idea of where profits are to be made. Ken Burns&#x2019;s documentaries, from the classic Civil War series to his one on World War II, are aired repeatedly. In Canada, Mark Starowicz&#x2019;s People&#x2019;s History drew millions of viewers. The Historica Minutes produced by the private foundation Historica, devoted to promoting Canadian history, are so popular among Canadian teenagers that they often do school projects where they make their own minutes. In the United Kingdom, David Starkey&#x2019;s series on British monarchs have made him rich and as famous as the kings and queens themselves.<br><br>Many governments now have special departments devoted to commemorating the past&#x2014;or, as it is often grandly designated, &#x201c;heritage.&#x201d; In Canada, the Department of Canadian Heritage exhorts Canadians to learn about Canada&#x2019;s history, culture, and land: &#x201c;Heritage is our collective treasure, given to us and ours to bequeath to our children.&#x201d; The term can encompass virtually anything: language, folk dances, recipes, antiques, paintings, customs, buildings. There are societies to celebrate antique cars or guns, baseball cards or matchboxes. In England, a young architect has founded the Chimneypot Preservation and Protection Society to save, as its mission decrees, &#x201c;the Sentinels of Time.&#x201d;<br><br>France, which has had a particularly active Ministry of Culture for decades, declared 1980 the Ann�e du Patrimoine. Locals dressed up to reenact the great moments of their history. In the following years, the number of heritage sites and monuments on the official list doubled. Scores of new museums&#x2014;devoted to the wooden shoe, for example, or the chestnut forest&#x2014;appeared. At the end of the decade, the government set up a special commission to oversee the commemoration of the two-hundredth anniversary of the French Revolution in 1989.<br><br>In France there has been an explosion of reenactments of the past, festivals, and special months, weeks, and days. The possibilities, of course, are endless: the starts and ends of wars, the births and deaths of famous people, the first publication of a book or the first performance of an opera, a strike, a demonstration, a trial, a revolution, even natural disasters. And the activity is not all government inspired; much comes from local and volunteer initiatives. Ch�lons-sur-Marne recognized the centenary of the invention of canning. It is not just in France that communities want to revisit their past: Perth, Ontario, had a week of festivities in 1993 to celebrate the giant cheese that it sent to the World&#x2019;s Fair in Chicago in 1893. As enterprising local governments and businesses have realized, the past is also good for tourism.<br><br>Governments tend to assume that proper attention and care of the past will do the present good. In the United States, the National Historic Preservation Act assumes that a sense of the past will help make good Americans. The nation&#x2019;s heritage must be preserved, it says, &#x201c;in order to give a sense of orientation to the American people.&#x201d; President George W. Bush&#x2019;s executive order of 2003 titled &#x201c;Preserve America&#x201d; echoed that sentiment: &#x201c;The Federal Government shall recognize and manage the historic properties in its ownership as assets that can support department and agency missions while contributing to the vitality and economic well-being of the Nation&#x2019;s communities and fostering a broader appreciation for the development of the United States and its underlying values.&#x201d;<br><br>The passion for the past is clearly about more than market forces or government policies. History responds to a variety of needs, from greater understanding of ourselves and our world to answers about what to do. For many human beings, an interest in the past starts with themselves. That is in part a result of biology. Like other creatures, humans have a beginning and an ending, and in between lies their story. It probably also has to do with the realization that today the great majority of people live in a rapidly changing world where long-standing relationships that were once taken for granted&#x2014;whether with places or with people such as family or friends&#x2014;no longer exist for many. Part of the current fascination with preserving heritage comes from the fear that we are losing priceless and irreplaceable pieces of the past, whether they are dying languages or decaying buildings. Sometimes the preservationists seem to want time itself to stand still. In New York, to take a current debate, should the tenements of the Lower East Side be replaced by modern, more salubrious buildings? Or should they be kept, as a spokeswoman for the Tenement Museum said, &#x201c;to remind us of the experience lived and worked inside them&#x201d;?<br><br>Nineteen million people around the world are now signed up to the online Friends Reunited, which will put you in touch with long-lost friends from the distant past, even from your earliest school days. If anyone wants to go still further back, and an increasing number of people do, he or she can research genealogies. It is understandable, said a spokesman for the College of Arms in London, &#x201c;in a throwaway society where everything is ephemeral.&#x201d; Most national archives now have special sections set aside for patrons who are investigating their family histories. Thanks to the Mormons, who collect parish registers, genealogies, and birth records for their own purposes, Salt Lake City houses an enormous worldwide collection of records. The Internet has made it even easier, with dozens of sites where you can search for your ancestors, with more specialized ones dedicated to a single family name. In Canada and the United Kingdom, the popular television show Who Do You Think You Are? caters to our fascination with celebrities and the hunt for ancestors as it traces back, often with surprising results, the family trees of the famous.<br><br>Recent developments in science make it possible to go beyond the printed records. The decoding of DNA means that scientists can now trace an individual&#x2019;s ancestry back through the mother&#x2019;s line and can find others with the same genetic makeup. As the databases of information build up, it becomes increasingly possible to see how human beings have migrated over the years. This is important for anyone who wants to go back beyond where the paper trail peters out. It is particularly important for those who never had much of a paper trail to begin with. Those immigrants who came in great waves to the New World in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to escape a miserable and uncertain life in Europe often lost all links with their pasts, sometimes indeed even their old names. For the descendants of American slaves, who lacked even the faintest hope of recovering the path their ancestors followed from Africa and not much more chance of finding out what happened to them once they were in the United States, DNA has suddenly opened the door to self-knowledge. A moving program called African American Lives, which was broadcast by PBS in 2006, looked at the DNA of famous black Americans, Oprah Winfrey and Quincy Jones among them. Sometimes the results are disappointing: family stories about the great-grandparent who was descended from kings are often just that&#x2014;stories. Sometimes there are surprises, as when an obscure professor of accounting in Florida found he was descended from Genghis Khan. Perhaps, thought the professor, he owed his administrative skills to his terrifying ancestor.<br><br>The current fascination for people&#x2019;s personal histories can be narcissistic&#x2014;how much time should human beings spend gazing at themselves, after all?&#x2014;but it also comes from the desire to know more about what made people who they are and what made the world in which they happen to live. If people can stand back and see their own histories in a wider perspective, then they can see how they are the products not just of particular individuals but of whole societies and cultures. Members of certain ethnic groups may find that they have inherited views on other ethnic groups, and may also find that others regard them in particular ways. History has shaped humans&#x2019; values, their fears, their aspirations, their loves, and their hatreds. When we start to realize that, we begin to understand something of the power of the past.<br><br>Even when people think they are striking out in new directions, their models often come from the past. How often have we seen revolutionaries, committed to building new worlds, slip back unconsciously into the habits and ways of those they have replaced? Napoleon came to power as the result of the French Revolution, but the court he set up was modeled on that of the displaced Bourbons. The top Soviet Communists lived within the walls of the Kremlin, as the czars had once done. Stalin looked back to Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great as his predecessors, as, I suspect, Vladimir Putin did when he was presi- dent. The Chinese Communists scorned China&#x2019;s traditional society, but their top leaders chose to live right at the heart of Beijing, where the imperial court had once been. Mao Zedong himself withdrew into mysterious seclusion, much as the emperors had done over the centuries.<br><br>&#x201c;Men make their own history,&#x201d; said Karl Marx, &#x201c;but they do not make it as they please: they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.&#x201d;<br><br>During the Cold War, though, history appeared to have lost much of its old power. The world that came into being after 1945 was divided up between two great alliance systems and two competing ideologies, both of which claimed to represent the future of humanity. American liberal capitalism and Soviet-style Communism were about, so they said, building new societies, per- haps even new human beings. The old conflicts, between Serbs and Croats, Germans and French, or Christians and Muslims, were just that and were consigned, in Leon Trotsky&#x2019;s memorable phrase, to the dustbin of history. The threat of massive nuclear war, of course, was always present, and from time to time, during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, it looked as if the last moment of the planet had come. But it did not, and in the end most of us simply forgot about the danger. Nuclear weapons took on a benign aspect: after all, the balance of terror meant that neither superpower dared attack the other without risking its own destruction. People at the time assumed that the United States and the Soviet Union would remain locked in their conflict, between war and peace, perhaps forever. In the meantime, the developed world enjoyed unparalleled prosperity, and new economic powers, many in Asia, appeared on the scene.<br><br>My students used to tell me how lucky I was to be teaching history. Once you have got a period or the events of a war straight, so they assumed, you don&#x2019;t have to think about them again. It must be so nice, they would say, not to redo your lecture notes. The past, after all, is the past. It cannot be changed. History, they seemed to say, is no more demanding than digging a stone out of the ground. It can be fun to do but not really necessary. What does it matter what happened then? This is now.<br><br>When the Cold War abruptly ended in 1989 with the collapse of the Soviet Empire in Europe, the world enjoyed a brief, much too brief, period of optimism. Collectively, it failed to recognize that the certainties of the post-1945 years had been replaced by a more complicated international order. Instead, most people assumed that as the remaining superpower, the United States would surely become a benevolent hegemon. Societies would benefit from a &#x201c;peace dividend&#x201d; because there would be no more need to spend huge amounts on the military. Liberal democracy had triumphed and Marxism itself had gone into the dustbin. History, as Francis Fukuyama put it, had come to an end, and a contented, prosperous, and peaceful world was moving into the next millennium.<br><br>In fact, many of the old conflicts and tensions remained, frozen into place just under the surface of the Cold War. The end of that great struggle brought a thaw, and long-suppressed dreams and hatreds bubbled to the surface again. Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s Iraq invaded Kuwait, basing its claims on dubious history. We discovered that it mattered that Serbs and Croats had many historical reasons to fear and hate each other, and that there were peoples within the Soviet Union who had their own proud histories and who wanted their independence. Many of us had to learn who the Serbs and Croats were and where Armenia or Georgia lay on the map. In the words of the title of Misha Glenny&#x2019;s book on central Europe, we witnessed the rebirth of history. Of course, as so often happens, some people went too far the other way and blamed everything that was going wrong in the Balkans in the 1990s, to take one of the most egregious cases, on &#x201c;age-old hatreds,&#x201d; which conveniently overlooked the wickedness of Slobodan Milo?evi�c,? then the president, and his ilk, who were doing their best to destroy Yugoslavia and dismember Bosnia. Such an attitude allowed outside powers to stand by wringing their hands helplessly for far too long.<br><br>The last two decades have been troubled and bewildering ones, and, not surprisingly, many people have turned to history to try to understand what is going on. Books on the history of the Balkans sold well as Yugoslavia fell to pieces. Today, publishers are rushing to commission histories of Iraq or to reissue older works. T. E. Lawrence&#x2019;s Seven Pillars of Wisdom, which describes the Arab struggle against Turkey for independence, is a bestseller again, and particularly popular with American soldiers serving in Iraq. My own book on the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, where so much of the foundation of the modern world was laid, could not find a publisher in the 1980s. As one publisher said, no one wanted to read about a bunch of dead white men sitting around talking about long-forgotten peace settlements. By the 1990s, the subject had come to seem a lot more relevant.<br><br>Today&#x2019;s world is far removed from the stasis of the Cold War. It looks more like that o...</p><h2>Never Love a Highlander (The Highlanders)</h2><p><b><b>Maya Banks, the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of romance and romantic suspense has captivated readers with her steamy Scottish historical novels, perfect for fans of Julie Garwood. In <i>Never Love a Highlander,</i> the youngest McCabe brother uses sword and seduction to save his clan&#x2014;and seal his heart.</b><br></b>&nbsp;<br>Caelen McCabe&#x2019;s young, reckless heart nearly destroyed his clan. Now, putting family loyalty above all else, he steps up to marry his older brother&#x2019;s jilted bride and salvage the uneasy alliance between two clans. While beautiful Rionna McDonald is a fit wife for any man, Caelen trusts no woman, especially not this sweet temptress who torments him with white-hot longing.<br><br>As the sacrificial lamb in her father&#x2019;s power game, Rionna will do her duty but vows to protect her heart and her pride from humiliation. Despite everything, though, the heat in Caelen&#x2019;s touch melts her defenses, and she craves the sensual delights of a husband who guards his emotions as fiercely as his clan. But when the ultimate battle for the McCabe legacy is upon them, Rionna&#x2019;s true warrior spirit emerges. She will risk the wrath of her father, the fury of her enemies, and her life to prove to Caelen that his wife&#x2019;s love is too precious to lose.</p><p><b>Maya Banks</b> is the bestselling author of <i>The Darkest Hour, No Place to Run, Hidden Away, Sweet Possession, Sweet Temptation, Colter&#x2019;s Woman,</i> and <i>Colter&#x2019;s Lady</i>. She lives in Texas with her husband, three children, and an assortment of pets.The weather for her first wedding had been a splendor of nature. An unseasonably warm day in January. Quite balmy with nary a breeze to ruffle her carefully arranged hair. It was as if the world stood still to witness the joining of two souls.<br> &nbsp;<br> A snort rippled from Rionna McDonald&#x2019;s throat, eliciting a raised eyebrow from her soon-to-be husband.<br> &nbsp;<br> The weather for her second wedding? Gloomy and dank with a winter storm pushing in from the west. Already a brisk chill had set in and the wind blew in fierce, relentless sheets. As if the world knew just how uncertain she was about the man who stood beside her, ready to recite the vows that would bind him to her forever.<br> &nbsp;<br> A shiver skirted up her spine despite the fact that they stood in front of the huge fire in the great hall.<br> &nbsp;<br> Caelen frowned and stepped closer to Rionna as if to shield her from the draft blowing through the furs at the window. She took a hasty step back before thinking better of it. The man made her nervous, and not many people intimidated her.<br> &nbsp;<br> He frowned harder, then turned his attention back to the priest.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rionna cast a quick glance around, hoping no one had witnessed that particular exchange. It wouldn&#x2019;t do for people to think she was afraid of her new husband. Even if she was.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ewan McCabe, the oldest McCabe brother and the first man she was supposed to have married, stood by his brother&#x2019;s side, his arms crossed over his broad chest. He looked anxious to be done with the whole thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Alaric McCabe, the man she&#x2019;d very nearly wed after Ewan got himself married to Mairin Stuart, also looked impatient and kept glancing toward the stairs as if he might run out at any moment. Rionna couldn&#x2019;t blame him, though. His new wife, Keeley, was above stairs recovering from a wound that had nearly ended her life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Third time was a charm, right?<br> &nbsp;<br> King David wasn&#x2019;t standing for the occasion. He sat regally by the fire, looking on with approval as the priest droned on. Around him, also sitting, were the many lairds from neighboring lands. All waiting for the alliance between the McDonalds and the McCabes. An alliance that would be sealed upon her marriage to Caelen McCabe, the youngest&#x2013;and last&#x2013;McCabe brother<br> &nbsp;<br> It was important to denote last because if anything went amiss with this wedding, there were no more McCabes for her to marry, and at this point, her pride couldn&#x2019;t withstand another rejection.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her gaze skittered from the king and assembled lairds to her dour-faced father who sat away from the assembled warriors, an unmanly, sullen pout twisting his features.<br> &nbsp;<br> For a moment their stares locked and then his lip turned up into a snarl. She hadn&#x2019;t supported him in his bid to keep his position of laird. It was probably disloyal of her. She wasn&#x2019;t sure that Caelen McCabe would be a better laird, but surely he was a better man.<br> &nbsp;<br> She became aware that all eyes were on her. She glanced nervously toward the priest and realized that she&#x2019;d missed her cue to recite her vows. Even more embarrassing, she had no idea what the man had said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is where you promise to obey me, cleave only unto me, and remain faithful all your days,&#x201d; Caelen drawled.<br> &nbsp;<br> His words stiffened her spine and she couldn&#x2019;t call back the glare as she speared him with her gaze.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And what exactly are you promising me?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> His pale green eyes stroked coolly over her, assessing and then lifting as if he found nothing of import. She didn&#x2019;t like that look. He&#x2019;d all but dismissed her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll gain my protection and the respect due a lady of your station.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> She whispered the words, and she&#x2019;d have given anything not to have let them slip. It was no wonder she&#x2019;d been left wanting, though. Ewan McCabe clearly adored his wife, Mairin, and Alaric had just defied king and country to be with the woman he loved&#x2014;effectively casting Rionna aside in the process.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not that she was angry. She dearly loved Keeley, and Keeley deserved happiness. That a man as strong and handsome as Alaric had publicly proclaimed his love for Keeley gladdened Rionna&#x2019;s heart.<br> &nbsp;<br> But it also brought home how sterile her own marriage would be.<br> &nbsp;<br> Caelen made a sound of exasperation. &#x201c;Exactly what is it that you want, lass?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She raised her chin and stared back at him every bit as cool. &#x201c;Nothing. &#x2019;Tis enough. I&#x2019;ll have your respect and your regard. I won&#x2019;t be needing your protection, though.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His eyebrow rose. &#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Aye. I can see to my own protection.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Caelen chuckled and more laughter rose from the assembled men. &#x201c;Say your vows, lass. We don&#x2019;t have all day. The men are hungry. They&#x2019;ve been waiting a feast for nearly a fortnight now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Agreement rumbled through the room and her cheeks burned. This was her wedding day and she wouldn&#x2019;t be rushed. Who cared about the food and the men&#x2019;s stomachs?<br> &nbsp;<br> As if sensing that she was working herself into a righteous fury, Caelen reached over, snagged her hand, and pulled her up next to his side until his thigh burned into hers through the material of her dress.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Father,&#x201d; Caelen said respectfully, &#x201c;if you&#x2019;ll tell the lass what she needs to say again.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rionna fumed the entire way through the recitation. Tears pricked her eyelids but she couldn&#x2019;t even say why. It wasn&#x2019;t as if she and Alaric had been a love match any more than she and Caelen were. The entire idea of wedding one of the McCabe brothers had been hatched by her father and embraced by the McCabes and the king himself.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was but a pawn to be used and discarded.<br> &nbsp;<br> She sighed and then shook her head. It was ridiculous to be this maudlin. There were worse things. She should be happy. She&#x2019;d rediscovered the sister of her heart in Keeley, who was now happily married even if she faced a long recovery in the days ahead. And Rionna&#x2019;s father would no longer be laird of their clan.<br> &nbsp;<br> She chanced another look only to see her father throw back yet another goblet of ale. She supposed she couldn&#x2019;t entirely blame him for being so deep into his cups. His entire way of life was gone in a moment&#x2019;s time. But she couldn&#x2019;t muster any regret.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her clan could be great&#x2014;would be great&#x2014;under the right leadership. It had never been her father. He&#x2019;d weakened the McDonald name until they&#x2019;d been reduced to begging for the aid and alliance of a stronger clan.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her free hand curled into a tight fist at her side. It had been her dream to restore their glory. To shape the soldiers into a formidable fighting force. Now it would be Caelen&#x2019;s task and she would be relegated to a position of observation rather than the participation she craved.<br> &nbsp;<br> She gasped in surprise when Caelen suddenly leaned in and brushed his lips across hers. He was gone almost before she registered what he&#x2019;d done and she stood there staring wide-eyed as she raised a trembling hand to her mouth.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ceremony was done. Even now the serving women were flooding into the hall, bearing a veritable bounty of food, much of which came from her own stores after her father&#x2019;s foolish wager several months ago.<br> &nbsp;<br> Caelen watched her a moment and then gestured for her to walk ahead of him toward the high table. Rionna was gratified to see Mairin join her husband. In a sea of gruff, indistinguishable faces, Mairin McCabe was a ray of sunshine. Tired sunshine, but warm nonetheless.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mairin hurried forward with a bright smile. &#x201c;Rionna, you look so beautiful. There isn&#x2019;t a woman here who can hold a candle to you today.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rionna&#x2019;s cheeks warmed under Mairin&#x2019;s praise. &#x2019;Twas the truth Rionna was a little ashamed to be wearing the same dress she&#x2019;d worn when she nearly married Alaric. She felt wrinkled, rumpled, and worn through. But the sincerity in Mairin&#x2019;s smile bolstered Rionna&#x2019;s flagging spirits.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mairin gathered Rionna&#x2019;s hands in hers as if to offer further encouragement.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, your hands are like ice!&#x201d; Mairin exclaimed. &#x201c;I did so want to be present for your joining. I hope you&#x2019;ll accept my regrets.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Rionna said with a genuine smile. &#x201c;How is Keeley fairing this day?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Some of the worry lifted from Mairin&#x2019;s gaze. &#x201c;Come, sit so we may be served. And then I&#x2019;ll tell you of Keeley.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It irked Rionna that she first looked to her new husband only to catch his nod of permission. She gritted her teeth and moved to the table to sit beside Mairin. Already she was acting like a docile nitwit and she hadn&#x2019;t been married five minutes.<br> &nbsp;<br> But in truth, Caelen frightened her. Alaric hadn&#x2019;t. Even Ewan didn&#x2019;t intimidate her. Caelen scared her witless.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rionna slid into the chair beside Mairin, hoping for a brief reprieve before Caelen joined her. She wasn&#x2019;t so fortunate. Her husband pulled out the chair next to her and scooted to the table, his leg so close to hers that it pressed to the whole of her thigh.<br> &nbsp;<br> Deciding it would be rude&#x2014;and obvious&#x2014;were she to slide toward Mairin, she decided instead to ignore him. She couldn&#x2019;t forget that it was acceptable for him to be so familiar now.

In the civil war, the contestants for supremacy&#x2014;aristocratic magnates, foreign kings, Cossack chieftains, impostors and adventurers&#x2014;had fought their way towards Moscow, hungry to seize the crown. But Michael Romanov and the Nun Martha were unenthusiastic. There has never been a more miserable, whining and melancholic procession to a throne. But the plight of Russia early in 1613 was dire, its trauma dystopian. The territory between Kostroma and Moscow was dangerous; Michael would pass through villages where dead bodies lay strewn in the streets. Russia was far smaller than the Russian Federation today; its border with Sweden in the north was close to Novgorod, that with Poland&#x2013;Lithuania close to Smolensk, much of Siberia in the east was unconquered, and most of the south was still the territory of the khanate of the Tatars. But it was still a vast territory with around 14 million people, compared to about 4 million in England at the time. Yet Russia had almost disintegrated; famine and war had culled its population; the Poles were still hunting the boy-tsar; Swedish and Polish&#x2013;Lithuanian armies were massing to advance into Russia; Cossack warlords ruled swathes of the south, harbouring pretenders to the throne; there was no money, the crown jewels had been looted; the Kremlin palaces were ruined.<br><br>The transformation of Michael&#x2019;s life must have been convulsive: the court of a tsar had to be reconstructed, courtier by courtier, silver spoon by silver spoon, diamond by diamond. He and his mother were undoubtedly terrified of what awaited them in the capital and they had every reason to be anxious. Yet now this teenager of an untitled noble family, whose father was lost in a foreign prison, found greatness thrust upon him, a greatness that he owed, above all, to the family&#x2019;s first patron, Ivan the Terrible.<br><br>Thirty years after his death, Ivan still cast his dread shadow over Russia and the boy Michael. Ivan had expanded the Russian empire&#x2014;and almost destroyed it from within. He had first boosted its splendour and then poisoned it&#x2014;a fifty-year reign of triumph and madness. But his first and favourite wife, the mother of his first brood of sons, was a Romanov&#x2014;and the founder of the family&#x2019;s fortunes.<br><br>Ivan himself was the scion of a royal family descended from Rurik, a semi-mythical Scandinavian prince who, in 862, was invited by Slavs and other local tribes to rule them, becoming the founder of the first Russian dynasty. In 988, Rurik&#x2019;s descendant Vladimir, grand prince of Rus, converted to Orthodoxy in Crimea under the authority of the Byzantine emperor and patriarch. His loose confederation of principalities, known as Kievan Rus, bound together by the Rurik dynasty, would ultimately extend almost from the Baltic to the Black Sea. But between 1238 and 1240 it was shattered by the Mongol armies of Genghis Khan and his family who, during their two centuries of Russian dominion, allowed Rurikid princes to rule small principalities as vassals. The Mongols&#x2019; view of a single universal emperor under God and their brutally arbitrary judicial decisions may have contributed to the Russian idea of autocracy. There was much mingling and marriage with the Mongols; many famous Russian families were descended from them. Gradually the Russian princes started to challenge Mongol authority: Ivan III the Great, grand prince of Moscow, had collected many of the Russian cities, particularly the republic of Great Novgorod in the north and Rostov in the south, under the Muscovite crown and in 1480 he decisively confronted the Mongol khans. After the fall of Byzantium to the Islamic Ottomans, he claimed the mantle of leadership of Orthodoxy. Ivan married the last Byzantine emperor&#x2019;s niece, Sophia Paleologue, which allowed him to present himself as heir to the emperors. Ivan the Great started to style himself &#x201c;Caesar,&#x201d; which was russianized into &#x201c;Tsar,&#x201d; his new imperial status allowing his monkish propagandists to assert that he was regathering the territories of Rus. His son Vasily III continued his work, but Vasily&#x2019;s son predeceased him so it was his grandson Ivan IV, Ivan the Terrible as he became, who succeeded to the throne as a toddler. His mother may have been poisoned and the child was traumatized when the rivalries of courtiers erupted into violence, growing up to be as magnetic, dynamic and imaginative as he was volatile and unpredictable.<br><br>At his coronation in 1547, when he was sixteen, Ivan was the first grand prince to be crowned tsar. The young autocrat had already launched his ritual search for a wife. In a tradition that derived from both of the precursors of tsardom&#x2014;Mongol khans and the Byzantine emperors&#x2014;he called a brideshow. Every choice of royal bride raised new clans to power and destroyed others. The brideshow was designed to diminish such turbulence by virtue of the tsar&#x2019;s deliberate choice of a girl from the middle gentry. Five hundred virgins were summoned from throughout his realm for this Renaissance beauty-contest, which was won by a girl named Anastasia Romanovna Zakharina-Yurieva, the great-aunt of the boy Michael.<br><br>The daughter of the minor branch of a clan that was already at court, Anastasia was ideal, thanks to her combining a safe distance from influential potentates with a comforting familiarity. Ivan knew her already since her uncle had been one of his guardians. She was descended from Andrei Kobyla, whom the grand prince had promoted to the rank of boyar in 1346&#x2013;7, but her branch of the family stemmed from his fourth son, the boyar Fyodor, who was called Koshka&#x2014;&#x201c;the Cat.&#x201d; Each generation was known by the name of the male in the generation before, so the Cat&#x2019;s children were dubbed the Koshkins, an appropriate designation given the Romanov family&#x2019;s feline gifts for survival. Anastasia&#x2019;s great-grandfather, Zakhar, and her grandfather, Yuri, were boyars, but her father Roman died young. However, he gave his name to the Romanovichi, who would become known as the Romanovs.<br><br>Soon after the coronation, on 2 February 1547, Ivan married Anastasia. The marriage was a success. She gave him six children of whom two male heirs survived, Ivan and Fyodor, and she had the gift of being able to calm his manic temperament. Yet he still exhausted her with his unpredictable frenzies and constant travels. At first his reign prospered: he marched south-eastwards on a Christian Orthodox crusade to defeat the Islamic Tatars, the descendants of Genghis Khan who were now divided into smaller khanates. First he conquered the khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan&#x2014;triumphs he celebrated by building St. Basil&#x2019;s Cathedral on Red Square; he despatched merchant adventurers and Cossack buccaneers to begin the conquest of vast, rich Siberia; he brought in European experts and merchants to modernize Muscovy and fought the Commonwealth of Poland&#x2013;Lithuania to control the rich cities of the Baltic. But it was to be a long war which undermined the sanity of the tsar and the loyalty of his overmighty grandees, many of whom had their own links to the Poles. At the same time, he was often at war with the other regional power, the khanate of the Crimean Tatars to the south.<br><br>In 1553, Ivan fell ill. His wife&#x2019;s brother Nikita Romanovich tried to persuade the courtiers to swear allegiance to the tsar&#x2019;s baby son&#x2014;but they refused, because they favoured his adult cousin, Prince Vladimir of Staritsa. The tsar recovered but emerged fixated on the treachery of his nobles and the independent allegiances of Prince Vladimir and the other magnates. In 1560, Anastasia died at the age of twenty-nine. Ivan was distraught, convinced she had been poisoned by hostile grandees. She may indeed have been poisoned, but she may just as easily have died of a disease or well-intentioned medicine. Either way, the defections and intrigues of his own magnates now sent Ivan into a spiral of violence: he suddenly withdrew from Moscow to a provincial stronghold whence he divided the realm between his private fief, the Separateness&#x2014;Oprichnina&#x2014;and the rest of the country. He unleashed a fearsome corps of black-clad upstart henchmen, the oprichniki, who astride black horses decorated with brooms and dog&#x2019;s heads, to symbolize incorruptibility and ferocious loyalty, launched a reign of terror. As Ivan lurched between spasms of killing, praying and fornication, no one was safe. His instability was exacerbated by the fragility of his dynasty: only his son Ivan seemed likely to survive to adulthood since the youngest Fyodor was not strong. It was essential to marry again&#x2014;which became an obsession like that of his contemporary Henry VIII. While he sought foreign brides, a princess from the dynasty ruling Sweden and Poland in the hope of winning the Polish throne, and an Englishwoman, possibly even Elizabeth I herself, Ivan worked his way through as many as eight wives, three of whom may have been poisoned, and some of whom may have been murdered on his own orders. When his second wife, a Tatar princess, died in 1569, another suspected victim of poisoning, he went berserk, purging his own ministers, cutting off noses and genitals, then descending with a posse of dog-headed oprichniki on to the cities of Tver and Novgorod, killing virtually their entire populations, treating victims with boiling then frozen water, hanging them from hooks inserted through their ribs, roping women and children together and pushing them under the ice. Taking advantage of Ivan&#x2019;s demented distractions, the Tatar khan captured and burned Moscow.<br><br>After the oprichniki had done his bidding, Ivan reunited the tsardom but then abdicated and appointed a Tatar khan&#x2019;s son, converted to Christianity, as grand prince of Russia before taking back the throne. There was some method in the madness: Ivan&#x2019;s cruelties broke the power of the territorial magnates&#x2014;even though they were garnished with the personal sadism of his diabolical idiosyncrasy. Anastasia&#x2019;s brother Nikita Romanovich remained the uncle of the heirs to the throne, but the Romanovs were no safer than anyone else from the tsar. In 1575, at least one Romanov was killed and Nikita&#x2019;s lands ravaged.<br><br>At a brideshow in September 1580, Ivan chose a new wife, Maria Nagaya, who gave him the son, Dmitri, that he craved. Yet, in 1581, in a rage he killed his own eldest son by Anastasia, Ivan, driving his iron-tipped staff into the boy&#x2019;s head, the awful climax of his reign. He had already debased Russia, but now he condemned it to chaos for the heirs to the throne were his other son by Anastasia, the weak and simple-minded Fyodor&#x2014;and the baby Dmitri.<br><br>On Ivan the Terrible&#x2019;s death in 1584, Nikita Romanovich helped ensure the succession of his nephew Fyodor I. But Nikita died soon afterwards and his influence was inherited by his son Fyodor Nikitich Romanov, future father of Michael.<br><br>Tsar Fyodor left the ruling to his able minister Boris Godunov, who had risen as one of Ivan&#x2019;s oprichniki and now consolidated his power by marrying his sister to the tsar. The last Rurikid heir was Ivan&#x2019;s youngest son, the eight-year-old Dmitri, who now vanished from the scene. He officially died from a knife wound to the throat, self-inflicted during an epileptic fit. This would have been such a freak accident it may actually have happened, but inevitably many believed he had either been assassinated by Godunov&#x2014;or been spirited away to safety.<br><br>When Tsar Fyodor died childless in 1598, the Muscovite line of the Rurikid dynasty was extinct.<br><br>There were two candidates for the throne&#x2014;Fyodor&#x2019;s minister and brother-in-law Boris Godunov, and Fyodor Romanov, eldest nephew of the late Tsarina Anastasia, and son of Nikita Romanovich, who was known as the best-dressed boyar at court. Fyodor Romanov married Ksenia Shestova, but of their six children, including four sons, only one daughter and one son survived: the future Tsar Michael was born in 1596 and was probably raised in a mansion near Red Square on Varvarka Street. He was showered with gifts but his childhood was not stable for long.<br><br>Godunov was elected tsar by an Assembly of the Land, so he was the nearest thing to a legitimate ruler after the extinction of the rightful dynasty, and he was initially backed by Fyodor Romanov. Godunov was gifted, but luck is essential in politics and he was unlucky. His enduring achievement took place on his eastern borders, where his Cossack adventurers managed to conquer the khanate of Sibr, opening up the vastness of Siberia. But Russia herself suffered famine and disease, while Boris&#x2019;s own illness undermined his tenuous authority.<br><br>Fyodor Romanov, whose intrigues and escapes displayed all the agility of his cat-like ancestors, helped spread the fatal rumours that Ivan the Terrible&#x2019;s late son Dmitri had escaped and was still alive. A showdown was nearing, and the Romanovs brought military retainers into Moscow. When Michael Romanov was only five, his world was destroyed.<br><br>In 1600, Godunov pounced on Fyodor and his four brothers, who were accused of treason and sorcery; their servants testified under torture to their practice of witchcraft and stashes of &#x201c;poisonous herbs.&#x201d; Tsar Boris burned down one of their palaces, confiscated their estates and exiled them to the Arctic. To ensure that Fyodor Romanov could never be tsar, he was forced to take holy orders, under a new priestly name Filaret, while his wife became the Nun Martha. Michael was sent to live with his aunt, t...</p><h2>Twas The Nightshift Before Christmas</h2><p><p><b>From the author of record-breaking million copy bestseller and 2018 Book of the Year, <i>This is Going to Hurt</i></b></p><p>Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat . . . but 1.4 million NHS workers are heading off to work.

He promised he&#x2019;d be here.</i></p><p>Controlling her panic, Tala looked around, quick, furtive glances. All she saw were the neighborhood residents, going about their business. Of course, at this time of the night, very little of their business was good.</p><p>Nobody noticed her. Nobody had followed her. She hoped.</p><p>She shrank back into the shadows, deciding to give him another minute. She had to get back before they discovered she&#x2019;d slipped away. If they hadn&#x2019;t already.</p><p>And if they had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. her life was over. Maybe literally. And not only <i>her</i> life. She&#x2019;d risked the lives of every member of her family, too. If she was caught, all of their lives would be forfeit. Yet she&#x2019;d risked it. Because of the baby.</p><p>Everything she did was for that little bundle who smiled and cooed because she wasn&#x2019;t yet old enough to know how bad the world really was. Tala would sell her soul to keep the baby safe, to keep her from being sucked into this hell&#x2014;as Tala had been when she was only fourteen years old.</p><p>That had been three years ago. Three years that had aged her a lifetime. Three years that had stolen the light from her mother&#x2019;s eyes and turned her proud father into a shell of a man. Her parents were frozen, powerless, because they feared for their children. Tala understood that. But she also understood that things couldn&#x2019;t continue as they were. So she&#x2019;d bided her time, waiting for the perfect moment.</p><p>This was about as perfect a moment as she was going to get. <i>Please come. Please.</i></p><p>If he didn&#x2019;t come, it would all have been for nothing.</p><p>A footstep had her spinning around, her eyes frantically searching the darkness as her pounding heart began to race. A man approached, a large man. Tala&#x2019;s fists tightened and she shifted her weight, preparing to flee in the event it was not the man she expected.</p><p>His step was slow. Careful. He lifted his hands, palms up. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me. I won&#x2019;t hurt you.&#x201d;</p><p>Her heart settled. He had the most beautiful voice. It had been what had drawn her to begin with. She&#x2019;d heard him singing quietly, sitting by the pond in the park where she was allowed to walk the ridiculous dog whose diamond-studded collar would have fed her family for a year. His voice had been so sweet it had made her want to weep.</p><p>And she had. She&#x2019;d stood that day, listening, the tears streaming down her cheeks. Later, she&#x2019;d paid for that stolen concert. She&#x2019;d paid dearly. Still, she&#x2019;d stopped to listen again when she walked the dog and saw him at the pond. She&#x2019;d stopped every night for a week. Because that, like this, had been worth the risk. She&#x2019;d been caught a second time a few nights before. Punished even more viciously.</p><p>Still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she hadn&#x2019;t been able to help herself. His song had drawn her, making her reckless. But even as her heart sang mournfully along with him, even when he&#x2019;d turned to see her standing there, tightly clenching the ridiculous dog&#x2019;s leash in her fist, even when he&#x2019;d asked her why she cried&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>She hadn&#x2019;t said a word. Not until today.</p><p>She hoped she wasn&#x2019;t making the biggest mistake of her life. Because she was putting her life and the lives of everyone she loved in his hands.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;</p><p>He came closer, his face still in the shadows. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Marcus,&#x201d; he said simply. &#x201c;Tell me why you cry.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Marcus</i>. She liked his name. Trusted his voice. But now that she was with him, her tongue seemed to be tied in knots. The secret she&#x2019;d kept for so long&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was stuck deep within her. The words would not come. She backed away. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go.

Why do you cry, Tala?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why do you?&#x201d; Because he had been.

He was only seventeen.&#x201d;</p><p>She swallowed hard. &#x201c;My age.&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded. &#x201c;Will you let me help you, Tala?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can&#x2019;t pay you.&#x201d;</p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need your money. I don&#x2019;t want it.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Oh,</i> she thought, suddenly realizing what he did want. Dread overwhelmed her, and she took another step back. Then she stopped, lifted her chin. Made her lips curve in what she knew to be a sensuous way. She reached for the waistband of his black jeans, steeling her voice to be as sexy as she could make it. &#x201c;I understand,&#x201d; she purred. &#x201c;I can make you feel good.&#x201d;</p><p>He blinked, looking shocked. Then horrified. <i>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</i> He took a giant step back. &#x201c;Stop. You don&#x2019;t understand. That&#x2019;s not what I want. I don&#x2019;t want anything from you. I just want to help you.&#x201d;</p><p>Tala&#x2019;s hands dropped to her sides. &#x201c;Why? Why would you help me? I&#x2019;m no one.&#x201d;</p><p>He shook his head again, slowly. Sadly. &#x201c;Everyone is someone,&#x201d; he murmured, then exhaled. &#x201c;Why do you cry, Tala?&#x201d;</p><p>His voice dipped deep, touched her soul. Made her eyes fill with hot tears. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s dangerous,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re dangerous. My family will die if I&#x2019;m found here.&#x201d;</p><p>His dark brows knit together. &#x201c;Who are you afraid of?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The man. His wife. They&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She averted her eyes, ashamed. &#x201c;They own us.&#x201d;</p><p>Marcus shifted, jaw clenching, eyes narrowing. &#x201c;How? Who?&#x201d;</p><p>At the edge of her vision she saw the glint of moonlight on metal&#x2014;but she was a split second too late. The flash of fire, the boom of thunder, the burning agony in her stomach, the scrape of asphalt on her face&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Tala!&#x201d; Marcus was shouting, but his voice was far away. So far away. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t die, dammit. Don&#x2019;t you die.&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t want to die. She hadn&#x2019;t yet lived. Her family&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She needed him to save her family. She opened her mouth to tell him so. &#x201c;Help Mala&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Her mouth moved but no sound came out. There was not enough air to carry her voice. <i>Say it. Tell him</i>. She forced herself to inhale, forced the word out in an agonized huff: &#x201c;Malaya.&#x201d;</p><p>And then a second burst of thunder tore the air, followed by the shock of a great weight crushing her. <i>Marcus.</i> He&#x2019;d been shot, too. Suddenly she could no longer draw even the shallowest breath.</p><p><i>I&#x2019;m going to die.</i> Her family was going to die. And the man called Marcus&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he&#x2019;d only wanted to help her. But now he was going to die, too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Cincinnati, Ohio</p><p>Tuesday, August 4, 2:49 a.m.</p><p>Detective Scarlett Bishop left her jacket in her car on purpose. Partly because it was too damned hot and sticky to even consider wearing a stitch more clothing than was absolutely necessary. But mostly so that the weapon holstered under her arm&#x2014;the Glock she normally kept concealed under a jacket&#x2014;would be readily seen.</p><p>She wasn&#x2019;t in the mood for any shit tonight.</p><p>Taking a look around, she frowned at the sight of the nearly deserted street. On any given night, this was where dealers and prostitutes peddled their wares. But nobody was peddling anything tonight, which made Scarlett uneasy. Something had sent them scurrying into their hidey-holes, and whatever that something had been, it wasn&#x2019;t likely to have been good.</p><p>There was no evidence of the man who&#x2019;d called her here&#x2014;asking her to come alone. Normally she would have been suspicious enough to bring backup. But the man&#x2019;s voice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She would admit this to no one but herself, but hearing his voice again after so many months had shaken her soundly. The number on her cell phone&#x2019;s caller ID was unfamiliar, but she&#x2019;d never forget his voice, no matter how long she lived. When she&#x2019;d heard it again on the phone tonight, it had stirred her from a sound sleep to full alertness. Nine months had passed without a single spoken word between them. And why would there have been? Her presence would bring him and his family only pain, remind them of their loss.</p><p>But tonight he&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;Can you meet me? Alone? Please. As soon as humanly possible.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d asked.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. important.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said. &#x201c;Where?&#x201d; But he&#x2019;d already hung up. A second later a text had popped up, specifying this street corner.</p><p>The last time he&#x2019;d called her out of the blue, his information had led her to four dead bodies. So, without hesitation, she&#x2019;d done as he&#x2019;d asked. But now he wasn&#x2019;t here.</p><p>The only visible signs of life on the street were the two homeless people eyeing her with unabashed interest from their spot on the stoop of the boarded-up building nearest to where she stood. She took two bottles of water from the trunk of her car, conscious of three other people peeking out from the windows of the building across the street. She handed a bottle to each of the two elderly people tucked up against the building for the night, their belongings in a shared shopping cart. Tommy and Edna were regulars on this corner. She&#x2019;d known them for years.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s hot,&#x201d; Scarlett said quietly.</p><p>&#x201c;A real scorcher,&#x201d; Tommy agreed, his teeth flashing white against his dark skin as he struggled with the bottle&#x2019;s cap, crowing when he twisted it off. &#x201c;Whatchu doin&#x2019; here this time of night, Miss Scarlett?&#x201d; he asked, exaggerating his deep drawl as he said her name.</p><p>&#x201c;Tommy,&#x201d; Scarlett chided gently, glancing up and down the street. Still no sign of her caller. &#x201c;Whatchu doin&#x2019; out here in this heat? You know it&#x2019;s not good for your heart.&#x201d;</p><p>Tommy sighed dramatically. &#x201c;My heart&#x2019;s done for already. It got all trampled on by you, Miss Scarlett, when I asked you to marry me for the very last time.&#x201d;</p><p>Scarlett&#x2019;s lips curved. Tommy was a rascal, but she genuinely liked him. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;d said yes, that really would be bad for your heart. You couldn&#x2019;t handle me.&#x201d;</p><p>Tommy&#x2019;s laugh was raspy from a lifetime of smoking. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right &#x2019;bout that.&#x201d; He lifted a finger in warning. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t be telling me to go to the Meadow. I been there three times this week. That pretty Dr. Dani says I&#x2019;m right as rain.&#x201d;</p><p>The seventy-year-old woman next to him snorted. Edna had lived on the streets of Cincinnati for as long as Scarlett had been a cop. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s full of shit, that one is, but he&#x2019;s telling the truth about the Meadow. He did go this week. Once.&#x201d;</p><p>Scarlett lifted her brows. &#x201c;And did Dr. Dani say he was right as rain?&#x201d;</p><p>Edna shrugged. &#x201c;Acid rain, maybe.&#x201d;</p><p>The Meadow was the local shelter and that &#x201c;pretty Dr. Dani&#x201d; was Danika Novak, ER doc and sister of Scarlett&#x2019;s partner, Deacon. Dani volunteered most of her free hours to the shelter and had roped most of their circle of friends into helping her, Scarlett included.</p><p>Scarlett shook her head but didn&#x2019;t push. It wouldn&#x2019;t do any good. She&#x2019;d found permanent housing for both Edna and Tommy a couple times over the years, but they always came back to the street. Which was bad for their health but, at times, beneficial to Scarlett&#x2019;s investigations. The two were a reliable source of information about the neighborhood.</p><p>She looked around again, but there was still no sign of the man she&#x2019;d come to meet. &#x201c;Have you two heard any trouble tonight?&#x201d;</p><p>Edna hid her water bottle in the deep pocket of the smock she never seemed to be without, then pointed to her left. &#x201c;You wanna look maybe three alleys down that way, honey. Gunshots. Three of &#x2019;em.&#x201d;</p><p>Scarlett&#x2019;s heart stuttered. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you say so before?&#x201d; she demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;Because you didn&#x2019;t ask,&#x201d; Edna said with a shrug.</p><p>&#x201c;Gunshots happen &#x2019;round here,&#x201d; Tommy added. &#x201c;We got to the point where we don&#x2019;t pay them no nevermind unless they&#x2019;re shootin&#x2019; at us.&#x201d;</p><p>Scarlett shoved her temper down. &#x201c;When was this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A few minutes ago,&#x201d; Tommy said, &#x201c;but I don&#x2019;t know &#x2019;xactly when. Don&#x2019;t got no watch,&#x201d; he added in a yell, because Scarlett had already started to run, her dread building.</p><p>Her phone had rung thirteen minutes ago. If he&#x2019;d been shot, he could be dead by now. He couldn&#x2019;t be dead. <i>Please don&#x2019;t let him be dead.</i></p><p>She skidded to a stop when she got to the alley, her vision drawn first to the motionless body on the ground. <i>It isn&#x2019;t him</i>. The victim was far too small to be him.</p><p>She drew her weapon with one hand, holding her Maglite in the other as she cautiously approached. She swept the beam of her light over the victim, a female who appeared to be of Asian descent. Who was she? And where was <i>he</i>? Another sweep of her light up and down the alley revealed no one else.</p><p>Scarlett crouched next to the body, her heart sinking. The victim, who appeared to be in her late teens, lay on her back, dark brown eyes staring up at the sky, wide and unseeing<i>. So young, </i>she thought. Setting the Maglite on the asphalt so that it illuminated the victim&#x2019;s face, she pulled a glove on to her left hand, keeping her weapon firmly gripped in her right.</p><p>Pressing her fingers to the victim&#x2019;s throat, Scarlett found no pulse, which was no surprise. But the young woman hadn&#x2019;t been dead long. Her skin was still warm.</p><p>Her lower torso was bare, her white polo shirt cut away to just below her breasts.</p><p>A bullet had entered three inches below her sternum but, based on the amount of blood on and around the body, it had probably not been immediately fatal. Cause of death was far more likely to have been the small hole in the victim&#x2019;s left temple. The exit wound behind her right ear was the size of Scarlett&#x2019;s fist.</p><p>The girl had been pretty before someone had taken out a chunk of her head.</p><p><i>Not him</i>. It couldn&#x2019;t have been him. Scarlett couldn&#x2019;t believe it. <i>You just don&#x2019;t want to believe it.</i> Which was fair enough, she supposed. Where was he?</p><p>Picking up the flashlight, she ran the beam over the body. Blood had been wiped from the exposed skin of the victim&#x2019;s midriff, the balled-up and blood-soaked remnant of her torn shirt lying on the ground next to her hip. Someone had attempted first aid.</p><p>&#x201c;He tried to save you,&#x201d; Scarlett murmured aloud.</p><p>&#x201c;Tried. Failed.&#x201d;</p><p>Her head jerked up. He was here. The man who&#x2019;d dominated her thoughts, her dreams. For months. The man who once again had called her out of the blue to the scene of a homicide.</p><p><i>Marcus O&#x2019;Bannion.</i></p></p><h2>The Confident Woman: Knowing Who You Are in Christ</h2><p><p>Many women believe that if they try hard enough to be the perfect Christian woman, God will honor their efforts.

Part action thriller and part courtroom drama, <i>Norco &#x2019;80</i> transports the reader back to the Southern California of the 1970s, an era of predatory evangelical gurus, doomsday predictions, megachurches, and soaring crime rates, with the threat of nuclear obliteration looming over it all.</p> <p>In this riveting true story, a group of landscapers transformed into a murderous gang of bank robbers armed to the teeth with military-grade weapons. Their desperate getaway turned the surrounding towns into war zones. When it was over, three were dead and close to twenty wounded; a police helicopter was forced down from the sky, and thirty-two police vehicles were destroyed by thousands of rounds of ammo. The resulting trial shook the community to the core, raising many issues that continue to plague society today: from the epidemic of post-traumatic stress disorder within law enforcement to religious extremism and the militarization of local police forces.</p></p><p><b>PETER HOULAHAN</b> is a freelance writer contributing to a wide range of publications.

Readers meet a people highly skilled in sculpture, astronomy, city planning, poetry, and philosophy, who were also profoundly committed to cosmic regeneration through the thrust of the ceremonial knife and through warfare. Davd Carrasco looks beyond Spanish accounts that have colored much of the Western narrative to let Aztec voices speak about their origin stories, the cosmic significance of their capital city, their methods of child rearing, and the contributions women made to daily life and the empire. Carrasco discusses the arrival of the Spaniards, contrasts Aztec mythical traditions about the origins of their city with actual urban life in Mesoamerica, and outlines the rise of the Aztec empire. He also explores Aztec religion, which provided both justification for and alternatives to warfare, sacrifice, and imperialism, and he sheds light on Aztec poetry, philosophy, painting, and especially monumental sculpture and architecture. He concludes by looking at how the Aztecs have been portrayed in Western thought, art, film, and literature as well as in Latino culture and arts.<br></p><p><br><strong>Davd Carrasco</strong> is the Neil L.

His fundamental work, <i>The Methods of Ethics<i> (first edition 1874, seventh and last edition 1907, here reprinted), is the clearest and most accessible formulation of what we may call 'the classical utilitarian doctorine.' This classical doctrine holds that the ultimate moral end of social and individual action is the greatest net sum of the happiness of all sentient beings. Happinesss is specified (as positive or negative) by the net balance of pleasure over pain, or, as Sidgwick preferred to say, as the net balance of agreeable over disagreeable consciousness. . . .</i></i></p></p><p>Published in 1874, Sidgwick&#39;s masterpiece argues the utilitarian approach to ethics and presents a systematic and historically sensitive approach to ethical research that influenced utilitarian philosophers well into the twentieth century. It remains a valuable introduction to the philosophy, practice and history of ethics.

She is especially fond of delving into missing pieces of<br>women&#x2019;s history. She coauthored a book, Women Under the Third Reich (Greenwood Publishing), and now has turned her attention to the infamous Madame Lalaurie and her incredible family. She has worked in public history facilities for more than twenty years and has her master&#x2019;s degree in American studies, specializing in cultural landscapes of garden cemeteries.<br><br>Lorelei Shannon has spent the better part of thirty years following Victoria Cosner Love around graveyards for her own inscrutable purposes. Lorelei and Victoria met at the tender age of fourteen. From the very start they shared a love of history&#x2015;particularly the obscure and unusual variety. While Victoria went on to become a respected historian, Lorelei became a novelist. She never lost her love of history, and she frequently incorporates historical elements in her southern gothic fiction. This is her first book-length work of nonfiction and her first collaboration with Victoria.</p><h2>Jesus: An Historical Approximation (Kyrios)</h2><p>In this Spanish best-seller, now available in English for the first time, the Biblical scholar Jose Antonio Pagola reconstructs the historical Jesus with a scholarly exegetical and theological approach. He addresses basic questions about who Jesus was; how he understood his life; what was the originality of his message; how the vision of he Kingdom of God centred his life; and why he was executed and who intervened in the process. The author presents a lively and passionate narrative of Jesus of Nazareth within the milieu of the first century, locating him in his social, economical, political and religious contexts based on current and accepted research. He also analyses the perspectives and conclusions of the most important scholars in this research and presents a profound and extensive scholarly theological reflection about Jesus.</p><p>ERIC HOFFER BOOK AWARD &#x2013; FINALIST<br><br>"This is an extraordinary work of scholarship. Beautifully written, it is also an expression of the author's profound faith commitment... the author nevertheless presents a compelling 'approximation of that life'. In so doing, Pagola has written a highly readable book that deserves a wide readership in the Church and the academy." - Roberto Goizueta, Boston College, Former President of the Catholic Theological Society of America.<br><br>"One of Pagola's most controversial stances is that Jesus never described his death in theological terms and did not understand it as a sacrificial atonement for the sins of humanity. 'The Father doesn't need to preserve his honor with anyone's destruction,' Pagola writes. His love for his sons and daughters is gratuitous, his forgiveness unconditional. Rather, Pagola says, 'Jesus viewed his death as &#x201c;a service to God's reign for the benefit of all.' Jesus: An Historical Approximation may frustrate conservatives, who fault Pagola for departing from traditional formulas of faith, as well as liberals, who wonder how a follower of Jesus can analyze the historical sources objectively." - Darrell Turner, National Catholic Reporter<br><br>"What makes this book unique is the author's stated intent to use the best of this scholarship to present a winsome and endearing portrait of Jesus' life and the milieu in which he lived, so as to awaken interest in the historical Jesus, stripped of pious trappings that have discouraged modern people from taking Jesus seriously." - Rev. Thomas Strieter, Ph.D., retired Lutheran pastor and professor, Chicago, IL.<br><br>"This volume aims to approximate Jesus with historical rigor and in simple language, in order to bring his person and message closer to people today." - New Testament Abstracts<br><br>"Pagola has a simple message to convey. God must be understood as compassion, not power. In his book he set out to depict, in clear, accessible layman's language, as much as the historical sources allow, a comprehensive picture of Jesus of Nazareth. Just who was he? What was his contemporary world really like? Why did he want to go beyond complex religious codes and ritual practices? And why did he end up on collision course with the local Jewish authorities and the delegates of imperial Rome?" - Mark Dowd, The Tablet, UK<br><br>"This is an original account of contexts related to Jesus, and is among the most inspired books in Biblical Studies I have read during the last decade." - Yves Laberge, Facult� de philosophie, Universit� Laval, Qu�bec, Canada<b>Jos� Antonio Pagola</b> was born in Spain in 1937. He completed his theological studies in 1962 at the Papal Gregorian University in Rome and his studies in Sacred Scripture at the Papal Biblical Institute in Rome in 1963. He also studied Biblical sciences at the Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem. Pagola is a professor at St. Sebastian Seminary and at the Faculty of Theology of Northern Spain. He has dedicated his life to Biblical studies and Christology and has done research on the historical Jesus for more than 30 year.</p><h2>Crinkleroot&#39;s Guide to Knowing Animal Habitats</h2><p>Join the folksy, friendly Crinkleroot for a fun, informative walk in the woods.

Fluctuating seas full of marine life, widespread floodplains and rivers choked with sediment, and mile-thick ice sheets from the north all shaped Ohio&#x2019;s present landscape.

Lederach leads readers through stories of conflict and reconciliation in Scripture, using these stories as anchors for peacemaking strategies that Christians can put into practice in families and churches.<br> <br> Lederach, who has written twenty-two books and whose work has been translated into more than twelve languages, also offers new lenses through which to view conflict, whether congregational conflicts or global terrorism.

Some she's bought, but many have been made for her by adoring fans and given to her as gifts. I don't make dragons, of course. But whenever circumstances allow, I do try to bring her American bacon, something she can't get easily in Ireland, and something which she has taught all her friends there to love, as well! I remember the first time I went to visit her, when she was still living in her old, much smaller but very homey, house. My husband and I arrived at the doorstep, and she immediately began bustling about, frying up some of the bacon we'd brought and sharing a lovely late breakfast with us before sending us off to the hotel for a nap. She made us dinner that night, too--the one and only time in my life that I've actually liked shrimp cocktail. Maybe that's because if you squint your eyes and look sideways, shrimp are kind of dragonlike, and I was eating them in the right company!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Shelly Shapiro, Executive EditorWhen the first humans came to settle the planet Pern, they did not come alone: intelligence-enhanced dolphins also crossed the stars, to colonize the oceans of the new planet while their human partners settled the vast continents. But then disaster struck in the form of Thread, deadly silver spores that fell like rain from the sky, devouring everything - and everyone - in their path. And as the human colonists&#39; dreams of a new, idyllic life shattered into a desperate struggle for survival, the dolphins were forgotten, left to make their own life in the seas of Pern. As time went by, human memory of dolphins was lost to legend, and only the occasional tall tale of &#34;shipfish&#34; rescuing fishermen lost at sea kept the legend alive. But the dolphins never forgot, and from generation to generation they preserved their oral history against the day when humans at last might remember their old friends, and once again the seas would resound with the ringing of the dolphins&#39; bells from docks and ships... Now, centuries later, the dragonriders of Pern were on the verge of ridding their planet of Thread forever. But T&#39;lion, a young bronze rider, was not old enough to participate in that great venture. Instead, he and his dragon, Gadareth, were relegated to conveying people from place to place - until he and Readis, son of the Lord Holder of Paradise River Hold, made contact with the legendary &#34;shipfish&#34;. And as the dragonriders grappled with the ending of an era, T&#39;lion, Readis, and the dolphins faced the start of a new one: reviving the bond between land- and ocean-dwellers and, in the process, resurrecting the dreams of the first colonists of Pern...</p><h2>Complexity: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>The importance of complexity is well-captured by Hawking's comment: "Complexity is the science of the 21st century". From the movement of flocks of birds to the Internet, environmental sustainability, and market regulation, the study and understanding of complex non-linear systems has become highly influential over the last 30 years.<br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, one of the leading figures in the field, John Holland, introduces the key elements and conceptual framework of complexity. From complex physical systems such as fluid flow and the difficulties of predicting weather, to complex adaptive systems such as the highly diverse and interdependent ecosystems of rainforests, he combines simple, well-known examples -- Adam Smith's pin factory, Darwin's comet orchid, and Simon's 'watchmaker' -- with an account of the approaches, involving agents and urn models, taken by complexity theory. <br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong> The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

His books have won every major history award--including the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award--and he has been universally praised for his prodigious research, his brilliant analytical skill, and his rich and powerful prose. Now, in <em>Inhuman Bondage</em>, Davis sums up a lifetime of insight in what Stanley L. Engerman calls "a monumental and magisterial book, the essential work on New World slavery for several decades to come."<br><br> Davis begins with the dramatic <em>Amistad</em> case, which vividly highlights the international character of the Atlantic slave trade and the roles of the American judiciary, the presidency, the media, and of both black and white abolitionists. The heart of the book looks at slavery in the American South, describing black slaveholding planters, the rise of the Cotton Kingdom, the daily life of ordinary slaves, the highly destructive internal, long-distance slave trade, the sexual exploitation of slaves, the emergence of an African-American culture, and much more. But though centered on the United States, the book offers a global perspective spanning four continents. It is the only study of American slavery that reaches back to ancient foundations (discussing the classical and biblical justifications for chattel bondage) and also traces the long evolution of anti-black racism (as in the writings of David Hume and Immanuel Kant, among many others). Equally important, it combines the subjects of slavery and abolitionism as very few books do, and it illuminates the meaning of nineteenth-century slave conspiracies and revolts, with a detailed comparison with 3 major revolts in the British Caribbean. It connects the actual life of slaves with the crucial place of slavery in American politics and stresses that slavery was integral to America's success as a nation--not a marginal enterprise. <br><br> A definitive history by a writer deeply immersed in the subject, <em>Inhuman Bondage</em> offers a compelling narrative that links together the profits of slavery, the pain of the enslaved, and the legacy of racism. It is the ultimate portrait of the dark side of the American dream. Yet it offers an inspiring example as well--the story of how abolitionists, barely a fringe group in the 1770s, successfully fought, in the space of a hundred years, to defeat one of human history's greatest evils.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Brion Davis</strong> is Sterling Professor of History Emeritus at Yale University and Director Emeritus of the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition, also at Yale. Best known for his highly acclaimed books <em>The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture, The Problem of</em> <em>Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823, Slavery and Human Progress</em>, and most recently, <em>Challenging the Boundaries of Slavery</em>, Davis has won a Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award for History and Biography, the Bancroft Prize, the Albert J.

Brown, <em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"<em>Inhuman Bondage</em> is, in essence, a retrospective: a brilliant and nuanced summing up of nearly fifty years' scholarship on slavery and abolition, much of it pioneered by Davis himself....It is a masterful study: broad in conception, bang up to date, consistently challenging, accessible and beautifully written."--John Oldfield, <em>Patterns of Prejudice</em><p></p><br>"<em>Inhuman Bondage</em> lives up to what readers expect from Davis: it is engagingly written and impressively broad in its scope and analysis."--Laurent Dubois, <em>American Historical Reivew</em><p></p><br>"A tour de force....Could not be more welcome....Davis follows the large story of slavery into all corners of the Atlantic world, demonstrating that hardly anyone or anything was untouched by it. He is particularly interested in the way ideas shaped slavery's development. But 'Inhuman Bondage' is not a history without people. Princes, merchants and reformers of all sorts play their role, though Davis gives pride of place to the men and women who suffered bondage. Drawing on some of the best recent studies, he not only adjudicates between the arguments, but also provides dozens of new insights, large and small, into events as familiar as the revolt on Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) and the American Civil War....An invaluable guide to explaining what has made slavery's consequences so much a part of contemporary American culture and politics."--Ira Berlin, <em>The New York Times Book</em> <em>Review</em><p></p><br>"Davis masterfully navigates the long history of slavery from ancient times to its abolition in the 19th century....Succeeds heroically in wrestling a vast amount of material from diverse cultures. The result is a sinewy book that combines erudition and everyday detail into a gripping, often surprising, narrative."--Fergus M. Bordewich, <em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"David Brion Davis has been the preeminent historian of ideas about slavery in the Western world since the early modern period....Davis, a leading practitioner of intellectual and cultural history, has now gone far beyond the history of ideas and attempted to study New World slavery in all its ramifications, social, economic, and political, as well as intellectual and cultural....He convincingly demonstrates that slavery was central to the history of the New World."--George M. Fredrickson, <em>The New York Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"David Brion Davis, our greatest historian of slavery and abolition, weaves together here one of the central stories of modern world history--and does so with a power, authority, and grace that is his alone."--Edward L. Ayers, author of <em>In the Presence of Mine Enemies: War in the Heart of America,</em> <em>1859-1863</em><p></p><br>"Ranging from ancient Babylonia to the modern Western Hemisphere, David Brion Davis offers a concise history of slavery and its abolition that once again reminds us why he is the foremost scholar of international slavery. There is no more up-to-date account of this pivotal aspect of the world's history."--Eric Foner, author of <em>Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877</em><p></p><br>"Impressive and sprawling....Davis's account is rich in detail, and his voice is clear enough to coax even casual readers through this dense history."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"In this gracefully fashioned masterpiece, David Brion Davis draws on a lifetime of scrupulous scholarship in order to trace the sources and highlight the distinctiveness of America's central paradox by situating it in both its New World and Western contexts. His powerful narrative is enhanced and deepened by persuasively rendered details. For students of slavery, and of American history more generally, it is simply indispensable. With all the makings of a classic, <em>Inhuman Bondage</em> is the glorious culmination of the definitive series of studies on slavery by one of America's greatest living historians."--Orlando Patterson, author of <em>Rituals of Blood: Consequences of Slavery in Two American Centuries</em><p></p><br>"No scholar has played a larger role in expanding contemporary understanding of how slavery shaped the history of the United States, the Americas and the world than David Brion Davis."--Ira Berlin, author of <em>Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America</em><p></p><br>"<em>Inhuman Bondage</em> is a magisterial achievement, a model of comparative and interdisciplinary scholarship, and the best study we have of American slavery within the broader context of the New World. It is also a powerful and moving story, told by one of America's greatest historians."--John Stauffer, author of <em>The Black Hearts of Men: Radical Abolitionists and the Transformation of Race</em><p></p><br>"This brilliant and gripping history of slavery in the New World summarizes and integrates the scholarship of the past half-century. It sparkles with insights that only an innovator of David Brion Davis's caliber could command."--Robert William Fogel, author of <em>The Slavery Debates, 1952-1990: A</em> <em>Retrospective</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Eastertide: Prayers for Lent Through Easter from The Divine Hours</h2><p><b>In her acclaimed trilogy<i>, The Divine Hours,</i> Phyllis Tickle introduced modern Christians to the time-honored practice of "praying the hours."

Sally Brown - school phobia, malapropisms, unrequited love for Linus and all - elbows her way to center stage, at least among the humans, and is thus the logical choice for cover girl... and in her honor, the introduction is provided by none other than television, Broadway and film star Kristin (<i>Pushing Daisies, Wicked</i>) Chenoweth, who first rose to Tony-winning fame with her scene-stealing performance as Sally in <i>You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown</i>. Speaking of introductions, Peppermint Patty's new permanent sidekick, the one and only Marcie, makes her debut, and then there's the birth of one Rerun Van Pelt! Also, Snoopy as Joe Cool, Woodstock in worm school, and much more!<br><br></p><p><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.Snoopy continues to dominate the proceedings in these 1971&#x2013;72 installments of the classic strip as he bonds with new friend Woodstock, appears for the first time in the guise of Joe Cool, serves as Peppermint Patty&#x2019;s attorney when she violates the school dress code, and has Linus&#x2019; security blanket made into a sports coat.

Some mestizos have migrated to Amazon towns and cities, such as Iquitos and Pucallpa; most remain in small villages. They have retained features of a folk Catholicism and traditional Hispanic medicine, and have incorporated much of the religious tradition of the Amazon, especially its healing, sorcery, shamanism, and the use of potent plant hallucinogens, including ayahuasca. The result is a uniquely eclectic shamanist culture that continues to fascinate outsiders with its brilliant visionary art. Ayahuasca shamanism is now part of global culture. Once the terrain of anthropologists, it is now the subject of novels and spiritual memoirs, while ayahuasca shamans perform their healing rituals in Ontario and Wisconsin.</p><p><i>Singing to the Plants</i> sets forth just what this shamanism is about--what happens at an ayahuasca healing ceremony, how the apprentice shaman forms a spiritual relationship with the healing plant spirits, how sorcerers inflict the harm that the shaman heals, and the ways that plants are used in healing, love magic, and sorcery.</p></p><p>"Eminently readable, clear, and engrossing...

They scaled roofs, broke locks, ripped refrigerator doors off their hinges. They wore night-vision goggles and slinked into private oak groves, their guards holding rifles and standing watch. Their hounds wove quietly through columns of stalky trees, snouts working chalky soils for a scent of the quarry. When the hounds&#x2019; paws scratched, the men darted toward patches of burnt earth and shoveled shallow holes with precision and speed. When their bags bulged, they screeched past moonlit vineyards onto country roads, into darkness. And they did all this not for cash, or for jewelry, or for art. It was for <i>les truffes,</i> the truffles.<br><br>By the time the winter sun rose each morning over the dusty peak of Mont Ventoux in 2005, large quantities of Provence&#x2019;s finest black winter truffle&#x2014;worth &#x20ac;500, &#x20ac;600, or even &#x20ac;1,000 per kilo on the commercial market&#x2014;had vanished from company storage rooms, middlemen&#x2019;s refrigerators, and, most frequently, the soils where hopeful farmers in the region of Vaucluse had once planted oak saplings inoculated with fungal spores. Victims reported the losses to the local gendarmerie, France&#x2019;s military police, but the heists&#x2014;occurring randomly across large stretches of agricultural land&#x2014;proved difficult to solve and to marshal serious resources for. The village authorities occasionally recovered abandoned trucks and stolen rope but rarely located the product or witnesses with useful leads. Though American eaters typically think of truffles as foraged foods, found in misty stands of wild forest, the majority of the French supply of black winter truffles comes from the small and inconsistent yields of cultivated oak groves on the outskirts of several rural villages in the southeastern section of the country; farmers still have to search for the truffles, but at least they have some sense of where to look, as do the thieves.<br><br>On the narrow streets of Carpentras and Richerenches, the villages where the region&#x2019;s two main truffle markets are held, farmers swapped intelligence on the latest trespasses and nervously wondered if they would be targeted next. The thousands or even tens of thousands in lost sales would slow and harden the passage of winter, when there were few other things to nurture or sell. And the poachers&#x2019; careless digging would disrupt the delicate symbiosis the truffle spores had found with their host tree&#x2019;s roots, cutting into a lifetime of potential earnings and violating the sanctity of a years- and sometimes generations-long relationship between a man and his capricious grove. Only farmers who had planted, irrigated, pruned, and worried over their trees had the right to dig for their buried fruit; only they understood the improbability of their enterprise and the importance of scraping damp soil back over the holes.<br><br>Eventually, rumors devolved into paranoia and fear. Farmers suspected jealous neighbors and business rivals, and began patrolling their groves late on cold winter nights, clutching their hunting rifles.<br><br>Out of caution, some took out insurance policies on their product. The victims who already had them filed claims. One targeted trader was reimbursed with &#x20ac;76,000, on the condition that he improve his security system. The way the insurance brokers spoke about the necessity of the improvements, it was as if the countrymen had suddenly developed a weakness for exhibiting rare pieces of Chagall or wearing custom designs from Cartier.<br><br>But these missing black winter truffles were not unlike stolen jewels. The species Tuber melanosporum, known by the French as the black diamond or black pearl, is revered as one of the finest, scarcest, and most valuable ingredients in fine dining.<br><br>Even without criminal interference, a truffle&#x2019;s journey from spore to plate is so fraught with biological uncertainty, economic competition, and logistical headaches that a single shaving could be understood as a testament to the wonder of human civilization. After farmers plant inoculated saplings in suitable soil, the fruiting bodies of the fungi can take a decade before materializing below host trees, and even then, a hot summer, a pruning mishap, or an unexplained stroke of fate can rip them away. After decades of study, scientists still don&#x2019;t fully understand the mechanics of their growth. Yields in France have fallen dramatically for more than a century, first because of disruptions to and closures of truffle orchards during the world wars and later from rural development, declining precipitation, and higher temperatures. Or at least that&#x2019;s what most truffle scientists theorize. No one seems to truly understand why farmers have had such trouble returning to the gilded yields of the twentieth century&#x2019;s turn.<br><br>And when truffles do form, a farmer doesn&#x2019;t harvest as much as he hunts. Unlike most crops, they don&#x2019;t all come in at once. Over a few months, they appear in fits and spurts, in different places throughout the grove, and with little to no external clues about where they are. A farmer dawdles through his rows with an expensive and expertly trained dog, until the pet locates the scent of a black bulb buried in mud. Mark by mark, the farmer digs upon his canine&#x2019;s indication, often with no results. The farmer must pry his prizes from the hound&#x2019;s mouth, drive them to market, and approach a middleman, who has the audacity to haggle him down from his asking price, if he&#x2019;s intrigued enough by the shape and quality of the specimens to make an offer at all. It&#x2019;s a medieval undertaking in a smartphone world.<br><br>Once sold, the truffle makes its way, occasionally through secretive back channels, from a middleman&#x2019;s hand to a restaurant&#x2019;s kitchen, usually in less than thirty-six hours. The truffle is as fleeting as a cloud: With each passing minute, the fungus shrinks in size, dissipates in aroma and flavor, and edges closer to rot. No serious restaurant will buy a truffle that is more than ten days old.<br><br>Each winter, the world&#x2019;s fine-dining chefs compete&#x2014;sometimes hysterically&#x2014;over a limited global supply, personally inspect them for flaws the instant they arrive in the kitchen, and prepare the dishes they&#x2019;re featured on with the precision and concern a master gemologist takes to the polish of a final setting. The gnarled and pebbled black lumps are finally shaved&#x2014;often at the table&#x2014;over buttered tagliatelle noodles, farm-raised eggs, or foie gras, at a cost of more than a hundred dollars per serving. The thin slivers reveal brilliant white veins that snake through the dark center of the fungus. But by themselves, whole truffles look a bit like the strange, mangled droppings of a forest troll.<br><br>Truffles can make the people who eat them behave in strange ways. Puff Daddy once indelicately requested that the French celebrity chef Daniel Boulud (of Daniel in Manhattan) &#x201c;shave that bitch&#x201d; over his plate. Oprah refuses to travel without ensuring that she, her assistant, and her security detail have packed surplus truffle salt. In 2010, at an international auction benefitting charity, the Macau casino tycoon Stanley Ho placed a winning bid of $330,000 for two large pieces of white truffle, or Tuber magnatum pico&#x2014;a rarer, smoother-surfaced, and more expensive species (a kilo routinely wholesales for more than $7,000) with a pale yellow-brown complexion that cannot be cultivated and can only be found in a few places on earth. The anonymously wealthy ask their pilots to fly their helicopters directly from Monte Carlo to northern Italy for the express purpose of eating large, fresh white truffles at lunch, complete with &#x20ac;1,500 tips for the waitstaff. Others jet from Florida mansions to New York warehouses just to inspect their truffles before they purchase them.<br><br>But the task of cogently explicating the allure of truffles can transform even the fiercest food critics into hopeless, salivating romantics. The late <i>Time</i> magazine columnist Josh Ozersky once mused that the white truffle&#x2019;s scent recalled &#x201c;the pungent memory of lost youth and old love affairs.&#x201d; Truffles, he wrote, gave him &#x201c;something to aspire to, to talk about, to dream of and to save up for. In a world where essentially everything is available to everybody at all times, give or take a few seasonal vegetables, [their] rarity is luminous and riveting.&#x201d;<br><br>Asking even seasoned chefs and truffle industry insiders to describe what the fungus tastes or smells like is a bit like asking a priest why he believes in God. There are words and descriptors, sure, but they are only symbols of an experience. The truffle smells of cold mountain air, of forest and leaf litter, of wet earth. Its taste corresponds to these wild smells, but it also transcends them: It is one of the few foods that can take a mind to its source, even if the person that mind belongs to has never traveled there before. You are eating years of nature&#x2019;s labor, many mornings of a truffle dog&#x2019;s sniffing search, and a moment of exhilarating discovery. You are eating secrets, mystery, and danger too.</p><h2>Swimming Lessons</h2><p><p><strong>An&nbsp;exhilarating literary mystery,&nbsp;<em>Swimming Lessons</em>&nbsp;keeps readers guessing until the final page.</strong></p><p>Disenchanted by the life in which she&#x2019;s found herself, Ingrid Coleman writes letters&nbsp;to her husband, Gil, about the truth of their passionate and troubled marriage.

She embodied &#x201c;the slave&#x201d; as female and &#x201c;the woman&#x201d; as black, having achieved that status even in her own times. An indefatigable lecturer, Truth rounded out the two most important reform movements of the early nineteenth century. Today, photographs of Truth grace many a woman&#x2019;s office, and her name appears on lists of great Americans. Yet despite the familiarity of Truth the symbol, what she actually did in her lifetime remains surprisingly obscure. This incognizance stems in part from the unorthodoxy of the <i>Narrative of Sojourner Truth</i>, a multilayered presentation of her life as a slave, worker, and Christian in New York State, joined to a hodgepodge of a scrapbook, and eventually to a chapter on her death. Looking carefully at the whole of Truth&#x2019;s narrative can help us see the woman behind the words.</p><p>Truth&#x2019;s fame rests on her speech: her preaching, her singing, and her mastery of lightning repartee. But as Truth did not read or write, the words of others communicate her speaking genius. She first published her narrative in 1850, but as an author, her voice has not carried very far, compared to that of her contemporaries. Unlike Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs, whose narratives convey the tragedy of Southern slavery, Truth could not set her narrative in the South. For lack of familiar Southern trappings, the story of her enslavement in New York rests uneasily in the corpus of American ex-slave narratives. Truth&#x2019;s nonconformist (auto)biography puzzles students of American slavery with its seeming inauthenticity. Not knowing what to make of it, they often lay it aside. As a consequence, the neglected <i>Narrative of Sojourner Truth</i> seldom serves as an historical source, leaving Truth&#x2019;s slave experience in the North relatively unstudied.</p><p>That Truth was born in the Hudson River Valley of New York surprises many Americans, who know nothing of slavery in the North. One of tens of thousands of enslaved New Yorkers, Truth was born Isabella in Ulster County in about 1797. At the turn of the nineteenth century, more than 10 percent (3,220) of Ulster County&#x2019;s population of 29,554 was of African descent. Isabella spoke Dutch as her first language, for Dutch was the language of Ulster County&#x2019;s Huguenot settlers. At the time, at least 16 percent of Afro-New Yorkers grew up speaking Dutch. Most slaveholding households in New York held only one or two slaves, a pattern that dispersed black people all across the countryside. A large slaveholder like Isabella&#x2019;s first master might own six or seven people at a time, but very few New Yorkers owned more than twenty slaves.</p><p>Slavery was an important part of Northern life in 1800. Among American cities, only Charleston, South Carolina, had a larger black population than New York. New York City&#x2019;s 5,865 blacks (including five slaves owned by Founding Father John Jay) accounted for about 10 percent of the total population. Almost 1,000 of the 6,281 black people in Connecticut and 12,422 of the 16,824 black people in New Jersey were still enslaved. Black people lived among whites, Indians, and people of mixed race throughout the North. Former slaves were to be found even in Massachusetts.</p><p>In her childhood, Isabella lived with her own parents, Elizabeth (Mau Mau Bett) and James (Bomefree). As cottagers, Elizabeth and James farmed land let them by their master and worked in relative autonomy. But autonomy assured neither physical nor psychic comfort, nor could it offset their grief. When Isabella was a child, her parents had already sacrificed ten or twelve children to the slave trade. Then, at the age of about nine, Isabella, too, was sold away from her parents. Elizabeth and James&#x2019;s bereavement lodged permanently in Isabella&#x2019;s memory. Her new owners spoke no Dutch, Isabella knew no English, and miscommunication led to whippings whose motives the young girl could not understand. Her father helped arrange her sale to less vicious owners, who taught her to tend bar and swear like their tavern&#x2019;s clientele.</p><p>The man who would be Isabella&#x2019;s longtime master, John Dumont, bought her in 1810. She worked for the Dumonts until her emancipation by state law in 1827. While she lived with the Dumonts, Isabella married Thomas, a fellow slave; they had five children: Diana, born about 1815; Peter, born about 1821; Elizabeth, born about 1825; Sophia, born about 1826; and one who cannot be identified. Like many other Northern slaves, Isabella had worked out a deal with her master for emancipation a year early. When he broke his commitment, she completed her work for the crop year, walked away with her baby, Sophia, and spent the remaining eight months of her last year of legal enslavement earning wages from Isaac and Maria Van Wagenen (not Van Wagener, as in Olive Gilbert&#x2019;s text). The Van Wagenens belonged to the same Dutch Reformed Church as the Dumonts, but they held the same Holiness (Pentecostal) ideals of equality and simplicity that had led Isabella to the new Methodist Church in Kingston.</p><p>During the fateful year between the end of the summer of 1826 and the midsummer of 1827, Isabella experienced another upheaval (in addition to seizing her freedom and choosing her own religion). At the end of 1826, John Dumont sold her son Peter, who was only about five, to one of his in-laws. The child changed hands twice more, then landed in Alabama, where slavery was not expected to end. New York State law prohibited the sale of New York slaves into places where slavery would continue to be legal after 1827, but the law was routinely and massively contravened. Peter was only one of thousands of New Yorkers sold illegally into permanent bondage in the South.</p><p>Empowered by her new closeness to God, Isabella went to court and secured the return of her son, an unusual but not unique use of the judicial system. (In later years, Truth again invoked the law in her own behalf: in New York, in 1835, when she was accused of poisoning after the disintegration of the &#x201c;Kingdom of Matthias&#x201d;; and in Washington, D.C., in 1867, for discrimination in the streetcars.) Having recovered her son, Isabella left Ulster County for booming New York City in 1828.</p><p>In New York, Isabella lived and worked in wealthy households and honed her ability to move others through her speech. She began to shine as a preacher and singer at the revivals then common around New York City. Leaving the predominantly white John Street Methodist Church for the Zion African Church, she worshipped with other blacks, among whom she discovered some of her own siblings, whose sale had so grieved her parents. She soon left Zion African Church to join self-appointed messengers of God (who would today be called Pentecostals). In 1832 she followed the Prophet Matthias (n� Robert Matthews in upstate New York), one of the independent holy men inspired by the Second Great Awakening (see p. xiv). The &#x201c;Kingdom of Matthias&#x201d; lasted some three years, in New York City and in West-chester County, before succumbing to the strains of free love and one member&#x2019;s death in suspicious circumstances.</p><p>Although she remained in New York City, Isabella disappears from the historical record between the breakup of the &#x201c;Kingdom of Matthias&#x201d; in 1835 and her transformation into Sojourner Truth on 1 June 1843 at the height of Millerite Second Adventism (see page xv). As the itinerant preacher Sojourner Truth, she made her way across Long Island and up the Connecticut River Valley, arriving in Northampton, Massachusetts, in the late fall. Intending only to stay the night, Truth spent the better part of thirteen years in Northampton, first in the Northampton Association for Education and Industry (a cooperative manufacturing silk), then in her own house on Park Street, in what is now Florence. In the Northampton Association she met Garrisonian abolitionists and feminists for the first time and found an amanuensis, Olive Gilbert, to write her (auto)biography. The <i>Narrative of Sojourner Truth</i> was published in 1850, and the following year Truth set out to lecture and sell her book to audiences of reformers. In 1856 she and her three daughters moved to Battle Creek, Michigan.</p><p>Between 1851 and the Civil War, Truth persevered on the feminist abolitionist lecture circuit. Her appearance at a women&#x2019;s rights meeting in Akron, Ohio, in 1851 is well known, though misconstrued through a report written by Frances Dana Gage twelve years after the fact. In 1853 Truth had visited Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of the best-selling <i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</i>, to ask for a promotional statement for her book. Stowe complied, and the two never met again. Ten years later, in the midst of the Civil War, Stowe turned this encounter into an article for the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> entitled &#x201c;Sojourner Truth, the Libyan Sibyl.&#x201d; Stowe&#x2019;s errors (that Truth was dead, that she had not been a committed feminist) inspired Frances Dana Gage, the radical feminist writer who had chaired the 1851 meeting in Akron, to publish&#x2014;two weeks after &#x201c;The Libyan Sibyl&#x201d; appeared&#x2014;her own version of Sojourner Truth&#x2019;s 1851 comments. Gage pointed out that Truth was still active and living in Battle Creek, Michigan. Gage also reorganized Truth&#x2019;s words and heightened the drama by borrowing Stowe&#x2019;s scenario. In place of Stowe&#x2019;s &#x201c;Frederick, is God dead?&#x201d; Gage substituted a rhetorical question of her own invention: &#x201c;Ar&#x2019;n&#x2019;t I a Woman?&#x201d; So, while Truth was associated during the nineteenth century with Stowe&#x2019;s &#x201c;Frederick, is God dead?&#x201d; by the mid-twentieth century, Gage&#x2019;s secular, feminist &#x201c;Ar&#x2019;n&#x2019;t I a Woman?&#x201d; had replaced Stowe&#x2019;s more evangelical phrase as Truth&#x2019;s identifying words.</p><p>Meanwhile, Truth was celebrating the turn of national politics for the first time in her life. With the outbreak of the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s Emancipation Proclamation, she jettisoned her Garrisonian disdain of politics to campaign for Lincoln&#x2019;s reelection. She visited Lincoln in 1864 and stayed on to assist the impoverished freedpeople clustering in the District of Columbia, a mission that occupied women abolitionists now that emancipation had practically been assured. The end of the war dried up the supply of jobs in Washington, presenting a further challenge to abolitionists. In 1867 Truth and another abolitionist, Josephine Griffing, attempted to find employment for Washington&#x2019;s refugees in the North and West, but the logistics of so ambitious an operation exceeded the two women&#x2019;s resources. A frustrated Truth envisioned another solution: the refugees&#x2019; permanent resettlement in the West. The quest for Western land engaged the balance of her public career without diminishing her feminist advocacy.</p><p>Like many old abolitionists, Truth had long supported a range of women&#x2019;s rights, including&#x2014;but not limited to&#x2014;the right to vote. And like many old abolitionists after the war, Truth espoused &#x201c;universal suffrage&#x201d; (voting for women and former slaves). But once the Fourteenth Amendment inserted the word &#x201c;male&#x201d; into the Constitution for the first time, explicitly limiting citizenship rights to men, abolitionists divided. On one side, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B.

Beginning in 1829 off the west coast of Africa with the recapture of the slave ship <em>Neirs�e</em>--previously seized by the British Navy in its efforts to suppress the "inhuman traffick"--and ending with the liberation of the African passengers who had been sold into slavery in the French Caribbean, Rafe Blaufarb puts a human face on the history of the transatlantic slave trade and the efforts to suppress it. He addresses a neglected aspect of this tragic history in the wide geographical and thematic contexts in which it took place--Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, and the Atlantic Ocean--and situates the story in familial, social, economic, diplomatic, and military spheres. <em>Inhuman Traffick</em> shows how history is done by explaining how the documents on which it is based moved through time and space from the ships, African outposts, colonial buildings, and ministerial offices to the archives of present-day Britain and France.<br><br>Blaufarb follows the ship, its crew, and its captives from the slave port of Old Calabar to the Caribbean and into the courts of Britain and France, where the history of the illegal slave trade, slavery in the Caribbean, and diplomatic history all come into focus. Students will be taken in by the vivid drawings and the rich narrative, but in Blaufarb's skilled hands, they will also find themselves immersed in a unique learning experience. Blaufarb not only presents the history of the ship and its captives, he takes the reader inside the project itself. He explains how he came upon the story, how he and his editor envisioned the project, and how he worked with illustrator Liz Clarke to craft more than 300 "cells" that comprise Part II of the book. He and Clarke even take the reader inside archives in France and Britain.<br><br>This powerful combination of historical essay, graphics, primary-source documents, and discussion questions gives students insight into the Atlantic World plantation complex, the transatlantic slave trade, and the process of historical storytelling itself.<br></p><p><br><strong>Rafe Blaufarb</strong> is Professor of History and the Ben Weider Eminent Scholar at Florida State University. <br><br><strong>Liz Clarke</strong> is a professional illustrator based in Cape Town, South Africa.<br><br>"A must read for all those interested in nineteenth-century Atlantic history."--Ugo Nwojeki, <em>University of California, Berkeley</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Rafe Blaufarb and Liz Clarke have created an innovative and engaging teaching tool for the transatlantic slave trade in the era of suppression. It combines exhaustive research with accessibility, offers a superb overview of the traffic, and provides extensive original documentation of one of the most dramatic and poignant incidents in nineteenth-century maritime history."--David Eltis, <em>Emory University</em> <br><p></p><br>"Drawing together Kru sailors, Sierra Leonean craftsmen, illegal French slavers, British anti-slavery patrol ships, a corrupt Guadeloupe governor, and British and French politicians, Blaufarb weaves a remarkable tapestry of the historical forces that transformed the slave trade in the nineteenth century. <em>Inhuman Traffick</em> offers a beautifully illustrated panorama of the Atlantic World during the age of emancipation, one that will appeal to students and experts alike."--James Sweet, <em>University of Wisconsin-Madison</em> <br><p></p><br>"The use of graphic histories in the classroom is becoming widespread, and <em>Inhuman Traffick</em> shows why they can work so effectively to engage students. Like all of the best examples of the genre, <em>Inhuman Traffick</em> tells a compelling story through a complex interplay of image and text--it will keep students reading, and learning, to the very end."--Randy Sparks, <em>Tulane University</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Inhuman Traffick</em> is a tour de force."--Rebecca Hartkopf Schloss, <em>Texas A&amp;M University</em> <br><p></p><br>"We are treated to the historical equivalent of 3D cinema as Dr. Blaufarb hits us from all angles: a traditional narrative that is concise and accessible; an innovative graphic history that brings the struggle against the slave trade to life; and a selection of primary sources that underscores the painstaking process by which historians explore the past. This is a truly groundbreaking approach to history."--Philippe Girard, <em>McNeese State University</em> <br><p></p><br>"My students will be delighted to have <em>Inhuman Traffick</em> added to their reading list."--Patrick Rael, <em>Bowdoin College</em> <br> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>The French Revolution and Human Rights: A Brief History with Documents (Bedford Series in History and Culture)</h2><p>Exploring the issue of rights and citizenship, <em>Revolutionary France, French Revolution and Human Rights</em> uses original translations and commentary of both debates and legislation that led to the French development of the modern concept of human rights.</p><p><p><b>Lynn Hunt</b> (Ph.D., Stanford University) is Distinguished Research Professor at University of California, Los Angeles.

Evangelization takes place in obedience to the missionary mandate of Jesus: &#x201c;Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you&#x201d; (Mt 28:19&#x2013;20). In these verses we see how the risen Christ sent his followers to preach the Gospel in every time and place, so that faith in him might spread to every corner of the earth.<br>I. A CHURCH WHICH GOES FORTH<br><br>20. The word of God constantly shows us how God challenges those who believe in him &#x201c;to go forth.&#x201d; Abraham received the call to set out for a new land (cf. Gn 12:1&#x2013;3). Moses heard God&#x2019;s call: &#x201c;Go, I send you&#x201d; (Ex 3:10) and led the people toward the promised land (cf. Ex 3:17). To Jeremiah God says: &#x201c;To all whom I send you, you shall go&#x201d; (Jer 1:7). In our day Jesus&#x2019;s command to &#x201c;go and make disciples&#x201d; echoes in the changing scenarios and ever new challenges to the Church&#x2019;s mission of evangelization, and all of us are called to take part in this new missionary &#x201c;going forth.&#x201d; Each Christian and every community must discern the path that the Lord points out, but all of us are asked to obey his call to go forth from our own comfort zone in order to reach all the &#x201c;peripheries&#x201d; in need of the light of the Gospel.<br><br>21. The Gospel joy which enlivens the community of disciples is a missionary joy. The seventy-two disciples felt it as they returned from their mission (cf. Lk 10:17). Jesus felt it when he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and praised the Father for revealing himself to the poor and the little ones (cf. Lk 10:21). It was felt by the first converts who marveled to hear the apostles preaching &#x201c;in the native language of each&#x201d; (Acts 2:6) on the day of Pentecost. This joy is a sign that the Gospel has been proclaimed and is bearing fruit. Yet the drive to go forth and give, to go out from ourselves, to keep pressing forward in our sowing of the good seed, remains ever present. The Lord says: &#x201c;Let us go on to the next towns that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out&#x201d; (Mk 1:38). Once the seed has been sown in one place, Jesus does not stay behind to explain things or to perform more signs; the Spirit moves him to go forth to other towns.<br><br>22. God&#x2019;s word is unpredictable in its power. The Gospel speaks of a seed which, once sown, grows by itself, even as the farmer sleeps (Mk 4:26&#x2013;29). The Church has to accept this unruly freedom of the word, which accomplishes what it wills in ways that surpass our calculations and ways of thinking.<br><br>23. The Church&#x2019;s closeness to Jesus is part of a common journey; &#x201c;communion and mission are profoundly interconnected.&#x201d;1 In fidelity to the example of the Master, it is vitally important for the Church today to go forth and preach the Gospel to all: to all places, on all occasions, without hesitation, reluctance or fear. The joy of the Gospel is for all people: no one can be excluded. That is what the angel proclaimed to the shepherds in Bethlehem: &#x201c;Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of a great joy which will come to all the people (Lk 2:10). The book of Revelation speaks of &#x201c;an eternal Gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tongue and tribe and people (Rv 14:6).<br><br>Taking the first step, being involved and supportive, bearing fruit and rejoicing<br><br>24. The Church which &#x201c;goes forth&#x201d; is a community of missionary disciples who take the first step, who are involved and supportive, who bear fruit and rejoice. An evangelizing community knows that the Lord has taken the initiative, he has loved us first (cf. 1 Jn 4:19), and therefore we can move forward, boldly take the initiative, go out to others, seek those who have fallen away, stand at the crossroads and welcome the outcast. Such a community has an endless desire to show mercy, the fruit of its own experience of the power of the Father&#x2019;s infinite mercy. Let us try a little harder to take the first step and to become involved. Jesus washed the feet of his disciples. The Lord gets involved and he involves his own, as he kneels to wash their feet. He tells his disciples: &#x201c;You will be blessed if you do this&#x201d; (Jn 13:17). An evangelizing community gets involved by word and deed in people&#x2019;s daily lives; it bridges distances, it is willing to abase itself if necessary, and it embraces human life, touching the suffering flesh of Christ in others. Evangelizers thus take on the &#x201c;smell of the sheep&#x201d; and the sheep are willing to hear their voice. An evangelizing community is also supportive, standing by people at every step of the way, no matter how difficult or lengthy this may prove to be. It is familiar with patient expectation and apostolic endurance. Evangelization consists mostly of patience and disregard for constraints of time. Faithful to the Lord&#x2019;s gift, it also bears fruit. An evangelizing community is always concerned with fruit, because the Lord wants her to be fruitful. It cares for the grain and does not grow impatient at the weeds. The sower, when he sees weeds sprouting among the grain does not grumble or overreact. He or she finds a way to let the word take flesh in a particular situation and bear fruits of new life, however imperfect or incomplete these may appear. The disciple is ready to put his or her whole life on the line, even to accepting martyrdom, in bearing witness to Jesus Christ, yet the goal is not to make enemies but to see God&#x2019;s word accepted and its capacity for liberation and renewal revealed. Finally an evangelizing community is filled with joy; it knows how to rejoice always. It celebrates every small victory, every step forward in the work of evangelization. Evangelization with joy becomes beauty in the liturgy, as part of our daily concern to spread goodness. The Church evangelizes and is herself evangelized through the beauty of the liturgy, which is both a celebration of the task of evangelization and the source of her renewed self-giving.<br>II. PASTORAL ACTIVITY AND CONVERSION<br><br>25. I am aware that nowadays documents do not arouse the same interest as in the past and that they are quickly forgotten. Nevertheless, I want to emphasize that what I am trying to express here has a programmatic significance and important consequences. I hope that all communities will devote the necessary effort to advancing along the path of a pastoral and missionary conversion which cannot leave things as they presently are. &#x201c;Mere administration&#x201d; can no longer be enough.2 Throughout the world, let us be &#x201c;permanently in a state of mission.&#x201d;3<br><br>26. Paul VI invited us to deepen the call to renewal and to make it clear that renewal does not only concern individuals but the entire Church. Let us return to a memorable text which continues to challenge us. &#x201c;The Church must look with penetrating eyes within herself, ponder the mystery of her own being . . . This vivid and lively self-awareness inevitably leads to a comparison between the ideal image of the Church as Christ envisaged her and loved her as his holy and spotless bride (cf. Eph 5:27), and the actual image which the Church presents to the world today . . . This is the source of the Church&#x2019;s heroic and impatient struggle for renewal: the struggle to correct those flaws introduced by her members which her own self-examination, mirroring her exemplar, Christ, points out to her and condemns.&#x201d;4 The Second Vatican Council presented ecclesial conversion as openness to a constant self-renewal born of fidelity to Jesus Christ: &#x201c;Every renewal of the Church essentially consists in an increase of fidelity to her own calling . . . Christ summons the Church as she goes her pilgrim way . . . to that continual reformation of which she always has need, in so far as she is a human institution here on earth.&#x201d;5<br><br>There are ecclesial structures which can hamper efforts at evangelization, yet even good structures are only helpful when there is a life constantly driving, sustaining and assessing them. Without new life and an authentic evangelical spirit, without the Church&#x2019;s &#x201c;fidelity to her own calling,&#x201d; any new structure will soon prove ineffective.<br><br>An ecclesial renewal which cannot be deferred<br><br>27. I dream of a &#x201c;missionary option,&#x201d; that is, a missionary impulse capable of transforming everything, so that the Church&#x2019;s customs, ways of doing things, times and schedules, language and structures can be suitably channeled for the evangelization of today&#x2019;s world rather than for her self-preservation. The renewal of structures demanded by pastoral conversion can only be understood in this light: as part of an effort to make them more mission-oriented, to make ordinary pastoral activity on every level more inclusive and open, to inspire in pastoral workers a constant desire to go forth and in this way to elicit a positive response from all those whom Jesus summons to friendship with himself. As John Paul II once said to the bishops of Oceania: &#x201c;All renewal in the Church must have mission as its goal if it is not to fall prey to a kind of ecclesial introversion.&#x201d;6<br><br>28. The parish is not an outdated institution; precisely because it possesses great flexibility, it can assume quite different contours depending on the openness and missionary creativity of the pastor and the community. While certainly not the only institution which evangelizes, if the parish proves capable of self-renewal and constant adaptivity, it continues to be &#x201c;the Church living in the midst of the homes of her sons and daughters.&#x201d;7 This presumes that it really is in contact with the homes and the lives of its people, and does not become a useless structure out of touch with people or a self-absorbed group made up of a chosen few. The parish is the presence of the Church in a given territory, an environment for hearing God&#x2019;s word, for growth in the Christian life, for dialogue, proclamation, charitable outreach, worship and celebration.8 In all its activities the parish encourages and trains its members to be evangelizers.9 It is a community of communities, a sanctuary where the thirsty come to drink in the midst of their journey, and a centre of constant missionary outreach. We must admit, though, that the call to review and renew our parishes has not yet sufficed to bring them nearer to people, to make them environments of living communion and participation, and to make them completely mission-oriented.<br><br>29. Other Church institutions, basic communities and small communities, movements, and forms of association are a source of enrichment for the Church, raised up by the Spirit for evangelizing different areas and sectors. Frequently they bring a new evangelizing fervour and a new capacity for dialogue with the world whereby the Church is renewed. But it will prove beneficial for them not to lose contact with the rich reality of the local parish and to participate readily in the overall pastoral activity of the particular Church.10 This kind of integration will prevent them from concentrating only on part of the Gospel or the Church, or becoming nomads without roots.<br><br>30. Each particular Church, as a portion of the Catholic Church under the leadership of its bishop, is likewise called to missionary conversion. It is the primary subject of evangelization,11 since it is the concrete manifestation of the one Church in one specific place, and in it &#x201c;the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church of Christ is truly present and operative.&#x201d;12 It is the Church incarnate in a certain place, equipped with all the means of salvation bestowed by Christ, but with local features. Its joy in communicating Jesus Christ is expressed both by a concern to preach him to areas in greater need and in constantly going forth to the outskirts of its own territory or toward new sociocultural settings.13 Wherever the need for the light and the life of the Risen Christ is greatest, it will want to be there.14 To make this missionary impulse ever more focused, generous and fruitful, I encourage each particular Church to undertake a resolute process of discernment, purification and reform.<br><br>31. The bishop must always foster this missionary communion in his diocesan Church, following the ideal of the first Christian communities, in which the believers were of one heart and one soul (cf. Acts 4:32). To do so, he will sometimes go before his people, pointing the way and keeping their hope vibrant. At other times, he will simply be in their midst with his unassuming and merciful presence. At yet other times, he will have to walk after them, helping those who lag behind and--above all--allowing the flock to strike out on new paths. In his mission of fostering a dynamic, open and missionary communion, he will have to encourage and develop the means of participation proposed in the Code of Canon Law,15 and other forms of pastoral dialogue, out of a desire to listen to everyone and not simply to those who would tell him what he would like to hear. Yet the principal aim of these participatory processes should not be ecclesiastical organization but rather the missionary aspiration of reaching everyone.<br><br>32. Since I am called to put into practice what I ask of others, I too must think about a conversion of the papacy. It is my duty, as the Bishop of Rome, to be open to suggestions which can help make the exercise of my ministry more faithful to the meaning which Jesus Christ wished to give it and to the present needs of evangelization. Pope John Paul II asked for help in finding &#x201c;a way of exercising the primacy which, while in no way renouncing what is essential to its mission, is nonetheless open to a new situation.&#x201d;16 We have made little progress in this regard. The papacy and the central structures of the universal Church also need to hear the call to pastoral conversion. The Second Vatican Council stated that, like the ancient patriarchal Churches, episcopal conferences are in a position &#x201c;to contribute in many and fruitful ways to the concrete realization of the collegial spirit.&#x201d;17 Yet this desire has not been fully realized, since a juridical status of episcopal conferences which would see them as subjects of specific attributions, including genuine doctrinal authority, has not yet been sufficiently elaborated.18 Excessive centralization, rather than proving helpful, complicates the Church&#x2019;s life and her missionary outreach.<br><br>1 John Paul II, Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Christifideles Laici (December 30, 1988), 32: AAS 81 (1989) 451.<br><br>2 Fifth General Conference of the Latin American and Caribbean Bishops, Aparecida Document, June 29, 2007, 201.<br><br>3 Ibid., 551.<br><br>4 Paul VI, Encyclical Letter Ecclesiam Suam (August 6, 1964), 9, 10, 11: AAS 56 (1964), 611-612.<br><br>5 Second Ecumenical Vatican Council, Decree on Ecumenism Unitatis Redintegratio, 6.<br><br>6 John Paul II, Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Ecclesia in Oceania (November 22, 2001), 19: AAS 94 (2002), 390.<br><br>7 John Paul II, Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Christifideles Laici (September 30, 1988), 26: AAS 81 (1989), 438.<br><br>8 Cf.

Instead, it grows outside of the uterus, spreading to organs and nerves in and around the pelvic region. The resulting pain is so physically and emotionally insufferable that it can mercilessly dominate a woman&#x2019;s life. The average woman with endometriosis is twenty-seven years old before she is diagnosed. It is one of the top three causes of female infertility. The pain it emits can affect a woman&#x2019;s career, social life, relationships, sexual activity, sleep, and diet. It is incurable, but highly treatable. Unfortunately, though, it is rarely treated in a timely manner, if at all, because of misdiagnoses and/or a lack of education among those in the medical community.<p>This book gives hope to everyone connected to endometriosis. That includes every woman and young girl who has it, and the women and men in their lives &#x2013; the mothers, fathers, husbands, children, and friends &#x2013; who know something is wrong, but do not know what it is or what to do about it. This book is written at a level that everyone with ties to this disease can relate to and understand, but it is also for doctors with good intentions who lack the knowledge of how to diagnose or treat it.</p> <p><i>The Doctor Will See You Now</i> is for women determined to let the world know their stories so that every woman with this disease &#x2013; from the thirteen-year-old girl who is being told that her pain is &#x201c;part of becoming a woman&#x201d; to the woman who has been misdiagnosed for decades &#x2013; knows she is not alone. </p><p>Yes, her pain is real.</p><p>No, she is not crazy. </p><p>Yes, there is hope.</p></p><p><p>Tamer Seckin, MD, is a Board Certified gynecologist and laparoscopic surgeon in private practice in New York City, practicing at North Shore LIJ/Lenox Hill Hospital. He specializes in treating women with endometriosis. He is an internationally known specialist in minimally invasive advanced (laparoscopic) surgery, and is among a very limited number of gynecologic surgeons in the United States who is exclusively committed to the Deep Laparoscopic Excision of endometriosis.</p> <p>In 2009, Dr. Seckin founded the Endometriosis Foundation of America (EFA), the first research and advocacy foundation of its kind organized by a private physician to raise awareness and emphasize the critical value of surgical excision of endometriosis. Under his guidance as Medical Director, the EFA strives to increase disease recognition, provide advocacy, facilitate expert surgical training, and fund landmark endometriosis research.</p><p>"This comprehensive text, as the author hopes, is likely to raise awareness among other physicians and among general readers, particularly women who will now have the knowledge necessary to become powerful self-advocates."&#x2015;<i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i></p><p>"An empowering, pro-women look at an often misdiagnosed condition that can cause infertility and devastating pain."&#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>"As people, but especially as women, we have to be our own medical advocates.

Plus (and I'm a broken record on this), our pain &#x2015; especially if it's located between belly button and ass crack &#x2015; is often not treated with the seriousness we would hope. My particular journey to navigate has been endometriosis, and Tamer Seckin's <i>The Doctor Will See You Now: Recognizing and Treating Endometriosis</i>, written with sensitivity and spirit, is an amazing primer if you or someone you love is suffering. In a world where information is everywhere yet answers are hard to come by, Dr. Seckin offers comfort and guidance.&#x2015;<b>Lena Dunham</b></p><p>"The book&#x2019;s inspiring text is purposefully crafted so that every reader can relate and understand endometriosis not only medically, but also emotionally." -<i><b>National Pain Report</b></i></p><p>"One of the best endometriosis surgeons is Dr. Tamer Seckin, a premier gynecologist specializing in endometriosis.

Recent research has revealed a major genetic component to endometriosis; now is the time for the scientific community to put serious resources into better understanding this complex inflammatory disorder. Targeted research can lead to earlier diagnosis, improved treatments, and eventually, preventative care to put an end to Endo.&#x201c;&#x2015;<b>Peter K.

Dr. Tamer Seckin&#x2019;s <i>The Doctor Will See You Now</i> sheds light on this painful condition and advances the fight to help women with endometriosis through personal accounts and his breadth of knowledge. I&#x2019;ve worked with Dr. Seckin&#x2019;s co-founder of the Endometriosis Foundation of America, Top Chef star, Padma Lakshmi, to help women understand that there is hope and I know this book will do the same.&#x201d;&#x2015;<b>State Senator Jeff Klein</b></p></p><h2>Secondhand Spirits: A Witchcraft Mystery</h2><p><b>Love the vintage- not the ghosts</b><br><br> Lily Ivory feels that she can finally fit in somewhere and conceal her "witchiness" in San Francisco.

Tall and graceful, he had the too-perfect, unreal beauty seldom seen outside a movie theater. And we were a long way from Tinseltown. This was San Francisco, where &#x201c;silicon&#x201d; referred to computer chips, not plastic surgery.

They just call them warlocks.&#x201d;</p><p>He winced. &#x201c;Warlock&#x201d; means &#x201c;oath breaker&#x201d; in Old English, and calls to mind the men who betrayed their covens in the bad old burn-the-witches-at-the-stake days. Some male practitioners called themselves &#x201c;wizards&#x201d; or &#x201c;sorcerers,&#x201d; but most preferred &#x201c;witch.&#x201d; It was a solidarity thing.</p><p>There are as many different types of witches&#x2014;the good, the bad, the magnificently venal&#x2014;as there are familiars. Still, the vast majority of us are female. I had an inkling of the power of a traditional women&#x2019;s coven, but in my experience male witches were wild cards with a tendency to stir up trouble.</p><p>Nothing about Aidan Rhodes suggested otherwise.</p><p>&#x201c;Cute accent,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You twang.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not my fault. I grew up in Texas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know. I knew your father.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We worked together.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that right?&#x201d; My tone was nonchalant, but my mind was racing. Aidan Rhodes was not overtly threatening, but if my father was involved, all bets were off.</p><p>I glanced over at my coworker, Bronwyn, who was across the room preparing a concoction for a middle-aged client with a nasty case of eczema and a nastier case of an unfaithful husband. The women&#x2019;s heads were bent low as Bronwyn ground up dried herbs with a wooden mortar and pestle. They appeared absorbed in the task. Too absorbed. Aidan Rhodes, male witch, must have cast a cocooning spell. If so, they wouldn&#x2019;t hear a single word we said; indeed, wouldn&#x2019;t be aware of his presence at all.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not every day someone like you moves into the neighborhood, much less opens a shop.&#x201d; Aidan&#x2019;s long, elegant fingers caressed a pile of hand-tatted lace collars in the wicker basket on the counter. &#x201c;A retail store, though&#x2014;that surprises me. Unusual career path for one with your . . . talents.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is there a reason you&#x2019;re here?&#x201d; I asked, upgrading the man from a curiosity to an annoyance. I wasn&#x2019;t usually so abrupt with potential customers, but it seemed unwise to use the shopkeeper&#x2019;s standard greeting&#x2014;<i>May I help you?&#x2014;</i>in case I inadvertently obligated myself to him. <i>There&#x2019;s many a slip twixt cauldron and lip</i>, my grandmother Graciela had drilled into me. Words mattered in the world of spell casting, and a slip of the tongue could have dire consequences.</p><p>&#x201c;As a matter of fact, there is. I brought you a housewarming present.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, but that&#x2019;s not necessary.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m happy to do it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I can&#x2019;t accept.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, but I insist.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I said <i>no</i>, thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what it is yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not the&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pleased ta meetcha.&#x201d;</p><p>I whirled around to find a misshapen creature perched, gargoylelike, atop an antique walnut jewelry display case. He was small and bent, with a muscular body and scaly skin, a large head, a snoutlike nose and mouth, and outsize ears like a bat&#x2019;s. His fingers were long and humanlike, surprisingly graceful, but his enormous feet had three toes and long talons. His voice was deep and gravelly.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m your new familiar,&#x201d; it said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid not; I&#x2019;m a so&#x2014;&#x201d; I turned to give Aidan a piece of my mind, but he was gone, the door slowly swinging shut. The bell had once again failed to ring. I swore under my breath.</p><p>&#x201c;A <i>so</i> what, mistress?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Before you started swearing you said you were a <i>so</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t swearing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Were, too.&#x201d;</p><p>I blew out an exasperated breath. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a solo act. I don&#x2019;t need a familiar.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a witch, ain&#x2019;tcha? Ya gotta have a familiar.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Says who?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s in the handbook.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There <i>is</i> no handbook. Besides, I&#x2019;m allergic to cats.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m no cat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;ve noticed. But I&#x2019;m probably allergic to . . . . creatures such as yourself, too. Run along home to your master.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2019; Cause you&#x2019;re my master now, mistress.&#x201d; The creature attempted a smile, which took shape as a grimace.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious. Now <i>scoot</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>The grimace fell from his gnarled greenish gray face. Had it been possible, he would have paled. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing personal. I just don&#x2019;t need&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t send me away, mistress!&#x201d; he begged, jumping down from the display case. Even at full height he didn&#x2019;t reach my belly button. He dropped to his knobby knees and clasped his hands, gazing up at me in supplication. &#x201c;<i>Please</i> don&#x2019;t send me away. I&#x2019;ll be good, mistress, I swear.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t have a goblin in the shop!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not exactly a goblin.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gnome, then.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not really a gnome, either . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Whatever</i> you are, you&#x2019;ll scare away customers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Howzabout a pig?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A pig?&#x201d;</p><p>With a sudden twist of his scrawny shoulders, he transformed himself into a miniature Vietnamese pot bellied pig. He grunted, wagged his curly tail, and darted around the counter.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey! Get back here, you&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bless the Goddess, isn&#x2019;t he <i>sweet</i>!&#x201d; Bronwyn squealed, nearly knocking over a rack of 1950s-era chiffon prom dresses in her haste to cross the room. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;d he come from? I&#x2019;ve always wanted one of those! George Clooney had one&#x2014;did you know? They&#x2019;re <i>very</i> smart.&#x201d; Bronwyn scooped up the squealing swine and held him to her generous bosom, where, I couldn&#x2019;t help but notice, he stopped kicking and snuggled right in, his pale pink snout resting on her ample cleavage. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s his name?&#x201d;</p><p>I sighed. I had a million things to do today. Evicting a piggish gnome&#x2014;or a gnomish pig&#x2014;was not one of them.</p><p>&#x201c;His name&#x2019;s . . . Oscar,&#x201d; I said off the top of my head, thinking of the <i>Sesame Street</i> character. The ugly little fellow seemed as if he would feel at home in a garbage can. &#x201c;But he&#x2019;s not mine. He&#x2019;s a . . . loaner. He&#x2019;s just visiting.&#x201d;</p><p>Bronwyn and Oscar both ignored me.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Oscar</i>. Aren&#x2019;t you just a <i>darling</i>? Aren&#x2019;t you Bwon wyn&#x2019;s wuvey-dovey piggy-pig-pig?&#x201d; She crooned to the creature in the high-pitched, goofy tone humans reserve for cherished pets and preverbal children.</p><p>Oscar snorted and rooted around in her cleavage. Bronwyn chuckled. I sighed.</p><p>A plump woman in her mid-fifties, Bronwyn had fuzzy brown hair and warm brown eyes. She favored great swaths of gauzy purple clothing, lots of Celtic jewelry, and heavy black eye makeup. The first time I saw her I couldn&#x2019;t decide whether she was a delightfully free spirit or just plain nuts. Shortly after I opened my vintage clothing store, Aunt Cora&#x2019;s Closet, she had approached me about renting a corner of the shop for her small herb business.

The items are offensive and they were meant to be offensive. The items in the Jim Crow Museum served to dehumanize Blacks and legitimized patterns of prejudice, discrimination, and segregation. Using racist objects as teaching tools seems counterintuitive&#x2014;and, quite frankly, needlessly risky. Many Americans are already apprehensive discussing race relations, especially in settings where their ideas are challenged. The museum and this book exist to help overcome our collective trepidation and reluctance to talk about race. Fully illustrated, and with context provided by the museum's founder and director David Pilgrim, <i>Understanding Jim Crow</i> is both a grisly tour through America&#x2019;s past and an auspicious starting point for racial understanding and healing.</p><p><b>David Pilgrim</b> is a professor, orator, and human rights activist. He is best known as the founder and curator of the Jim Crow Museum&#x2014;a 10,000-piece collection of racist artifacts located at Ferris State University, which uses objects of intolerance to teach about race, race relations, and racism.

His is a crucial mission, because he forces us to realize that race relations grew worse in the first several decades of the twentieth century&#x2014;something many Americans never knew or now want to suppress. This book allows us to see, even feel the racism of just a generation or two ago&#x2014;and Pilgrim shows that elements of it continue, even today. See it! Read it! Feel it!

Under favorable circumstances, this process results in emotional healing, a radical shift in values, and a profound awareness of the mystical dimension of existence. For some, these changes are gradual and relatively smooth, but for others they can be so rapid and dramatic that they interfere with effective everyday functioning, creating tremendous inner turmoil. Unfortunately, many traditional health-care professionals do not recognize the positive potential of these crises; they often see them as manifestations of mental disease and repsond with stigmatizing labels, suppressive drugs, and even institutionalization.<p>In <b>The Stormy Search for the Self</b>, Christina and Stanislav Grof, the world's foremost authorities on the subject of spiritual emergence, draw on years of dramatic personal and professional experience with transformative states to explore these "spiritual emergencies," altered states so powerful they threaten to overwhelm the individual's oridinary reality. This book will provide insights, assurances, and practical suggestions for those who are experiencing or have experienced such a crisis, for their families and friends, and for mental-health professionals. It is also a valuable guide for anyone involved in personal transformation whose experiences, though generally untraumatic, may still at times be bewildering or disorienting.</p></p><p><b>Christina Grof</b> was raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, and graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in New York. Her original career as a teacher of art was interrupted when a powerful spiritual experience during childbirth launched her into many years of emotional turmoil, later identified as the manifestations of Kundalini awakening. She taught Hatha-Yoga and was deeply influenced by Swami Muktananda Paramahansa, head of the Siddha-Yoga lineage; she was his student until his death in 1982.<br><br>Her own unusual experiences generated in her deep interest in nonordinary states of consciousness and transpersonal psychology. Together with her husband, Stanislav Grof, she has developed Holotropic Breathwork, an experimental technique of psychotherapy that combines controlled breathing, evocative music, and bodywork. She and her husband have also organized international transpersonal conferences in Boston, Melbourne, Bombay, and Santa Rosa, California.<br><br>Christina's particular area of interest is the relationship between mysticism and psychosis. In 1980 she founded the spiritual emergence network, an international organization providing support for individuals undergoing transformative crises. More recently, her interest has extended into the area of the spiritual aspects of alcoholism and addiction. In the last decade she has conducted lectures and workshops in North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. She is also co-author of the book <b>Beyond Death</b>.This work presents a persuasive case for the existence of "spiritual emergencies"--extreme mental states experienced by some individuals in the process of personal metamorphosis. The Grofs (editors of Spiritual Emergency, Tarcher, 1989) denounce Western psychiatric practices that label persons in such states as mentally ill. They instead distinguish between psychiatric disorders and spiritual emergency, offering alternative modes of therapy for the latter. As the Grofs aim to show, the cycle of inner death and rebirth that typifies spiritual emergency ultimately leads to personal transformation and healing through a connection to a transcendent Higher Power or Higher Self. The last section offers self-help strategies, plus guidelines for family, friends, and mental health professionals. A bibliography is included. This radical treatise is recommended for large public and academic libraries.<br><i>- Amy A. Canadee, Cuyahoga Cty.

With the hand that was not holding the little black velvet box, he rubbed his hand across his jaw. He'd shaved for this and everything. The diamond winked in the candlelight, taunting him.<br><br>"Look, Jess," he said. "I'm tired of feeling like you pay me by the hour. I'm tired of you breaking up with me. Why don't we get married and stay together for the rest of our lives?"<br><br>"You ever hear that expression, if it ain't broke, don't fix it?"<br><br>"Do you see me here on one knee with an expensive ring in my hand?"<br><br>"Yes. You're hard to miss. And it's very pretty. But I get the feeling you think you <em>should</em> love me for the simple reason that we've been sleeping together on and off for so many years&#x2014;"<br><br>"No, it's genuine love."<br><br>"And secondly, you know how things are. I can't marry you. I have Davey."<br><br>"Well, I have Colleen, and she's a lot more trouble than your brother."<br><br>"Funny." Jessica's <em>three feet away</em> face was erasing any emotion. It was a face he'd seen all too often in the past two decades, as if she was saying, very politely, <em>keep three feet away from me or you'll lose an arm.</em><br><br>His knee was getting sore. "I know how things are with your brother, Jess. I don't think you're supposed to martyr yourself because of it."<br><br>"Don't go there. I love my brother. He comes first."<br><br>"So you basically have a life sentence."<br><br>"Yes," she said, as if she was explaining it to a two-year-old. "Davey's life. My life. They're inseparable. You think I should put him in a kennel for you?"<br><br>"Did I say the word <em>kennel?</em> No, I didn't. But I think you <em>could</em> tell him you're getting married and he can come live with us." Or in the group home in Bryer, which seemed like a very nice place. Yes, Connor had checked it out.<br><br>Her phone buzzed again. Again, she checked it. "Iron Man can fly."<br><br>"Jessica. I'm asking you to marry me." His jaw was getting tight.<br><br>"I know. And really, thank you. It's very sweet. Are we going to eat?"<br><br>"So you're not saying yes, is that it?"<br><br>"Yes. I'm not saying yes." She pushed a strand of silky blond hair behind her ear.<br><br>Jaw at one hundred percent lockdown. "Then it's a no."<br><br>"Sadly, yes, it's a no. Which I'm sure doesn't come as a huge surprise to you."<br><br>She was really turning him down.<br><br>Somehow, he'd seen this all going a bit differently.<br><br>Connor stood up, his knee creaking a little. Closed the little black velvet box and set it carefully on the table. He'd gone into Manhattan to buy that ring&#x2014;a simple and flawless emerald-cut diamond that suited her, because she was simply, flawlessly beautiful, too. Not a drop of makeup on, her long blond hair in a ponytail, wearing jeans and a faded T-shirt that said <em>Hugo's</em> on it, she was still the most gorgeous woman he'd ever seen.<br><br>"Shall I call for pizza?" she asked.<br><br>He sat down across from her. In the fridge were two lobsters, scallops, potatoes au gratin, artichoke and aru-gula salad, a bottle of Dom Perignon and <em>pots de cr�me au chocolat,</em> since his plan was to slide the ring on her finger, make love to her and then cook her the best meal of her life.<br><br>He did not want pizza.<br><br>He did not want a rejection.<br><br>His pulse was throbbing in his temples, a warning sign that he was mad. Brain-Vein, his irritating twin called it. He took a slow breath, looked around the room, trying not to lose his temper. The dining room...maybe that had been a mistake. It wasn't exactly warm and romantic. No pictures on the walls. His whole house looked like a furniture showroom, now that he thought about it.<br><br>Certainly, there were no pictures of him and Jessica. He leaned back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest. "How do you see us going forward, Jess?"<br><br>She was as cool and still as a stone in Keuka Lake. "What do you mean?"<br><br>"You and me, our future, our relationship, not that you can really call sneaking around at the age of thirty-two a relationship."<br><br>"I see us doing this. Getting together when we can. Enjoying each other's company." She wasn't the type to be goaded into an argument, that was for sure. Pity. A little yelling and some Olympic make-up sex would be more Connor's style. And that ring on her finger.<br><br>He made sure his voice was calm. Jess didn't do anger. "Do you ever think about us living together or marrying or having kids?"<br><br>"No. This works for me." She twisted the silver ring she wore on her thumb and gave him a pleasant smile.<br><br>"It doesn't work for me. Not anymore, Jess."<br><br>A person would need a magnifying glass to see any reaction from Jessica Dunn, but Connor was something of a student of her face. Right now her lips were pressed together the tiniest bit, indicating a disturbance in the Force.<br><br>"Well, thanks for letting me know," she said smoothly. "I'm sorry to hear that. You said you understood how things were and how they had to be. Nothing in my life has changed, so I'm not sure why you thought things would be different now."<br><br>"Davey can adjust."<br><br>"No, he can't, Connor. He has an IQ of fifty-two. And he hates you, or have you forgotten that? He can't even see you in the grocery store without having a meltdown. You remember the head-banging when he saw you with our dog?" Yes, Connor remembered. It had been one of the scariest moments of his life, as a matter of fact. "I don't have room for marriage and kids," Jess continued. "My brother is my responsibility in more ways than you could ever know. I'm surprised you brought marriage up at all. We've had this conversation a million times."<br><br>"Actually, we've never had this conversation."<br><br>Her cheeks were getting pink. Finally, something more than calm, cool and collected.<br><br>Good. It didn't seem fair that he was the only one feeling something here.<br><br>"Well, I thought you knew," she said. "I've always been very clear."<br><br>Blood thrummed through his temples, too hard, too fast. Another slow breath. "You're using your brother as an excuse. He'll adjust. He's held you hostage for years now."<br><br>"Do <em>not</em> go there, Connor."<br><br>"What I mean is&#x2014;"<br><br>"What you mean is, put him in a home."<br><br>She was really digging in now. "No, I don't," he said. "I bought this house with you in mind. There's an apartment upstairs, in case you forgot. It's for him. I love your brother."<br><br>"No, you don't. You've never even had a conversation with him, and he <em>certainly</em> doesn't love you. And let's not rewrite history. You decided to buy a two-family house without even talking to me."<br><br>Fair point. But it <em>had</em> seemed like a perfect solution; him and Jess downstairs, Davey upstairs. Instead, his sister had moved in after Jess turned him down.<br><br>Jessica sighed, some of the steel leaving her posture. "Connor, look. I think it's sweet that you made this gesture. Maybe it's because your sister's pregnant and you're feeling sentimental, but this just can't work. And I also think you're saying it because you're sure I won't say yes, and you're right. I won't."<br><br>"I wouldn't have asked if I didn't want you to say yes, Jessica."<br><br>Her phone buzzed again. She looked at the hateful device. "Great. Davey clogged the toilet, and Gerard can't get the valve to shut off. The last time the bathroom flooded, and I had to pay to replace the whole floor."<br><br>"Jess, I want you to marry me."<br><br>"I have to go. I'll see you Thursday, okay? This was a nice thought, Connor. I appreciate it. I really do." She stood up, kissed him on the head like he was a dog&#x2014;which he basically was, just some half-brain Labrador retriever you could ignore until you were lonely, and it was always happy to see you and would cheerfully forget the fact that you'd locked it in the cellar for a year or so. She grabbed her denim jacket from the hook by the door.<br><br>"Jessica." He didn't look at her, just stared at the candles flickering on the table. "This will be the last time you break up with me."<br><br>Well, shit. He hadn't really planned on saying that, but now that the words were out, they sprang up between the two of them like an iron door.<br><br>She froze for a second. "What do you mean?"<br><br>His head was killing him, every heartbeat stabbing behind his eyes. "I'm talking about all the times you've broken up with me, all the times you said life was too complicated, and you couldn't make any changes. I want a wife and kids and to be able to kiss you in public. If you leave now, make sure you mean it."<br><br>"Are you breaking up with me?" She actually sounded indignant.<br><br>"I'm <em>proposing!''</em><br><br>"Well, I have no idea why!" she snapped back. "You <em>know</em> this is the best I can do."<br><br>"Okay, then." His jaw clamped shut. Her mouth opened a little. "Really."<br><br>"Yep."<br><br>"Fine," she said. "Do what you want."<br><br>"Thanks. I will."<br><br>"Good."<br><br>"Fine."<br><br>She gave him a long look. "Have a nice night, Connor."<br><br>And with that, she left, and he picked up the stupid little black velvet box and threw it across the room.</p><h2>The Big Clock</h2><p><p><b>A classic of American noir, part murder mystery and part black comedy, set in dark corners of corporate New York City.&nbsp;</b><br><br>George Stroud is a hard-drinking, tough-talking, none-too-scrupulous writer for a New York media conglomerate that bears a striking resemblance to Time, Inc. in the heyday of Henry Luce. One day, before heading home to his wife in the suburbs, Stroud has a drink with Pauline, the beautiful girlfriend of his boss, Earl Janoth. Things happen.

The day after that, Pauline is found murdered in her apartment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Janoth knows there was one witness to his entry into Pauline&#x2019;s apartment on the night of the murder; he knows that man must have been the man Pauline was with before he got back; but he doesn&#x2019;t know who he was. Janoth badly wants to get his hands on that man, and he picks one of his most trusted employees to track him down: George Stroud, who else?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How does a man escape from himself?

There is no such thing as progress in literature, and as much as we pursue the latest thing, novelty is no advantage in a novel. <i>The Big Clock</i> provides the proof. Recently reissued in The New York Review of Books's Classics series (joining a disparate collection of neglected oldies including Max Beerbohm's Seven Men, Georges Simenon's The Man Who Watched Trains Go By and Elizabeth David's Summer Cooking), Fearing's intricate portrait of murder and the corporate mentality couldn't feel more current...

In the end he makes the punishment fit the crime, all right, but before that his main concern has been to make the whole show a source of scandalous merriment...At a venture one might say that <b><i>The Big Clock</i></b> is somewhat closer to the style of the surrealists than to that of Conan Doyle, but it should be added that the whole is overlaid with the familiar lacquer of the hard-boiled school...The best part of the book..is the man-hunt, which is conducted by the man who is being hunted, with all the resources of Janoth Enterprises behind him and all the aplomb in the world.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Fearing, poet and novelist, must now also be labeled a master of the tour de force. He has taken one of those tricky situations which always appeal to the short story writer and the mystery novelist and made it into an almost believable metropolitan melodrama. Even Agatha Christie with her penchant for difficult plot structure could have done no better with the material at hand - and I do not intend that as faint praise...You probably won't find a better thriller this year.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It will be some time before chill-hungry clients meet again so rare a compound of irony, satire, and icy-fingered narrative.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Weekly Book Review</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Not only does the brittle style support the characters' attitudes but also the psychological chase scene, in which George strives to elude his pursuers, is suspenseful until the end...a master at psychological suspense.&#x201d; - <i>Dictionary of Literary Biography </i></p></p><h2>Christian Women in the Patristic World: Their Influence, Authority, and Legacy in the Second through Fifth Centuries</h2><p>From facing wild beasts in the arena to governing the Roman Empire, Christian women--as preachers and philosophers, martyrs and empresses, virgins and mothers--influenced the shape of the church in its formative centuries.

Now he finds himself up against the very organization he been working for! </li> <li>This volume collects <i>Invincible</i> issues #48-53. </li></ul></p><p>Ten volumes and 63 monthly issues into its run, Invincible remains my favorite superhero comic currently being published. It's not perfect and it still has a way to go to match the heights of the greats in the field, but against the often bleak, disconnected, and thoroughly joyless fare of much of today's superhero fare, Invincible is a fun-filled standout.<br> <br>Perhaps it's because Invincible is not bogged down in decades of continuity or cross-company promotions and major event tie-ins. Writer Robert Kirkman is able to exercise free reign over his creation. There is, I should mention, a crossover with several of the other superheroes in Image's line within the opening pages of Who's the Boss?, but it doesn t feel forced or out of line - it just functions as a way of anchoring Invincible within the constructs of this particular universe.<br> <br>Who s the Boss? finds Invincible yet again questioning the foundations on which he's built not only his superhero identity but his very life. The young man, now in college, is the product of a Superman-like alien and a human mother. Past volumes told of how Mark Grayson discovered not only that his father, the superhero Omniman, turned out in truth to be the herald of an evil, destructive alien race bent on destroying Earth. Mark donned the guise of Invincible and fought against his more powerful father and nearly died in the process.<br> <br>With his father half a universe away, Mark went to work for Cecil Stedman, head of an ultra-secret government agency charged with protecting Earth from any threat. So far, Mark has done his job well, even while balancing the hormonal and emotional angst of any typical teenager.<br> <br>Those days are over, it seems. When Invincible discovers what Cecil has really been up to, everything changes, forming the basis of the plot line of Who s the Boss? Clever supporting plots carry out the theme, including Invincible's new romantic relationship with molecular-altering Atom Eve; the training of Invincible's powerful half-brother; and even the prospect of the hero moving back in with his mother...who is dating.<br> <br>Ably brought to life by artist Ryan Ottley, Invincible is the kind of escapist variety that used to make superhero books so much fun. That Kirkman still hasn't lost that, after almost seven years, is a testament to his carefully thought out envisioning of the character and the series. As it continues on, he finds new ways to keep the series exciting, and still a sheer joy to read.<br> <br>As always with Invincible collections, the back material is a nice bonus. This time, it includes alternate cover and interior art and a very interesting discussion on whether or not the violence in Invincible admittedly very bloody and graphic would fly at another major comic publisher. - John Hogan --Graphic Novel Reporter</p><h2>Silent Sky</h2><p>Play - 4w, 1mWhen Henrietta Leavitt begins work at the Harvard Observatory in the early 1900s, she isn&#39;t allowed to touch a telescope or express an original idea. Instead, she joins a group of women &#34;computers,&#34; charting the stars for a renowned astronomer who calculates projects in &#34;girl hours&#34; and has no time for the women&#39;s probing theories. As Henrietta, in her free time, attempts to measure the light and distance of stars, she must also take measure of her life on Earth, trying to balance her dedication to science with family obligations and the possibility of love. The true story of 19th-century astronomer Henrietta Leavitt explores a woman&#39;s place in society during a time of immense scientific discoveries, when women&#39;s ideas were dismissed until men claimed credit for them. Social progress, like scientific progress, can be hard to see when one is trapped among earthly complications; Henrietta Leavitt and her female peers believe in both, and their dedication changed the way we understand both the heavens and Earth.</p><p>"Vastly important yet little known, Henrietta Leavitt is the subject of "Silent Sky," Atlanta native Lauren Gunderson's luminously beautiful play. A lovingly crafted period piece that imagines Leavitt's inner world against the backdrop of World War I, Einstein's discoveries and the suffragette movement, "Silent Sky" is an intellectual epic told on an intimate scale." - The Atlanta Journal-Constitution<br><br>"Sheer magic. Smart, infectious humor." The San Francisco Chronicle<br><br>"Gunderson's writing strikes a balance between the cerebral and poetic that's ideal for this subject matter. She has a flair for a nicely turned line, as when Peter says: "For weeks, you've been the brightest object in my life - and we work with stars."

Nesbit. Among Nesbit s best-known works are The Story of the Treasure-Seekers, The Railway Children, The Wouldbegoods and Five Children and It. Nesbit s novels departed from the children s literary tradition of fantasy-worlds popularized by Lewis Carroll and Kenneth Grahame, and instead focused on the adventures to be had from real-life experiences. Nesbit s work inspired other writers like C. S. Lewis, P. L Travers, and J. K. Rowling, and many of her stories have been adapted for film and television. In addition to writing, Nesbit was an activist and co-founded the Fabian Society, a socialist group that provided the foundation for the modern British Labour Party. Nesbit died in 1924.They were not railway children to begin with. I don't suppose they had ever thought about railways except as a means of getting to Maskelyne and cook's, the Pantomime, Zoological Gardens and Madame Tussaud's. They were just ordinary suburban children, and they lived with their Father and Mother in an ordinary red-brick-fronted villa, with coloured glass in the front door, a tiled passage that was called a hall, a bathroom with hot and cold water, electric bells, French windows, and a good deal of white paint, and 'every modern convenience', as the house-agents say.There were three of them. Roberta was the eldest. Of course, Mothers never have favourites, but if their Mother had a favourite, it might have been Roberta. Next came Peter, who wished to be an Engineer when he grew up; and the youngest was Phyllis, who meant extremely well.Mother did not spend all her time in paying dull calls to dull ladies, and sitting dully at home waiting for dull ladies to pay calls to her. She was almost always there, ready to play with the children, and read to them, and help them to do their home-lessons. Besides this she used to write stories for them while they were at school, and read them aloud after tea, and she always made up funny pieces of poetry for their birthdays&nbsp; and for other great occasions, such as the christening of new kittens, or the furnishing of the dolls house, or the time when they were getting over the mumps.These three lucky children always had everything they needed: pretty clothes, good fires, a lovely nursery with heaps of toys, and a Mother Goose wallpaper. They had a kind and merry nursemaid, and a dog who was called James and who was their very own. They also had a Father who was just perfect - never cross, never unjust, and always ready for a game - at least, if at any time he was not ready, he always had an excellent reason for it, and explained the reason to the children so interestingly and funnily that they felt sure he couldn't help himself.You will think that they ought to have been very happy. And so they were, but they did not know how happy till the pretty life in Edgecombe Villa was over and done with, and they had to live a very different life indeed...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>The Accumulation of Capital</h2><p>2015 Reprint of 1951 Edition. Full facsimile of the original edition. Not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. First published in 1913 and generally held to be her finest achievement, this volume reveals Luxemburg as a Marxist critical of Karl Marx. It offers a theory of the dynamic development of capitalism which is of continued relevance to contemporary scholarship. Taking Marx as her starting point, she offers an independent and fiercely critical explanation of the economic and political consequences of capitalism in the context of the turbulent times in which she lived, reinterpreting events in the United States, Europe, China, Russia and the British Empire. Most today believe there is no alternative to global capitalism. This book is a timely and forceful statement of an opposing view. Rosa Luxemburg was born in 1870 in Russian Poland. She was murdered in Germany while on way to prison. Contains an introduction by Joan Robinson.</p><p>Rosa Luxemburg was a leader of the German Social Democratic Federation and jailed for her opposition to WWI.

During that revival, both the knowledge and the practice of lectio divina have become more widespread. In Praying the Bible Mariano Magrassi reintroduces us to this practice of prayerful reading of the word of God which is our heritage. With his vast knowledge of the Fathers and medieval monastic writers, Archbishop Magrassi synthesizes the unique and extraordinary experience of lectio divina. What is it? What are its key ideas? What are the necessary personal dispositions? What are the steps by which prayed reading is transformed into genuine contemplation? In Praying the Bible Magrassi answers these questions, providing a discussion that contains a healthy challenge and an invitation to grow.</p><p>Archbishop Mariano Magrassi, O.S.B., became archbishop of Bari in 1977.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Italian</p><h2>When Good Kids Make Bad Choices: Help and Hope for Hurting Parents</h2><p><p>There is perhaps no greater fear in a parent's heart than the thought that a much-loved and well-cared-for child will make bad choices or even become a prodigal.</p><p>What are parents to do in such circumstances?

In <i>Vexy Thing</i> Imani Perry resurrects patriarchy as a target of critique, recentering it to contemporary discussions of feminism through a social and literary analysis of cultural artifacts from the Enlightenment to the present. Drawing on a rich array of sources&#x2014;from nineteenth-century slavery court cases and historical vignettes to writings by Toni Morrison and Audre Lorde and art by Kara Walker and Wangechi Mutu&#x2014;Perry shows how the figure of the patriarch emerged as part and parcel of modernity, the nation-state, the Industrial Revolution, and globalization. She also outlines how digital media and technology, neoliberalism, and the security state continue to prop up patriarchy. By exploring the past and present of patriarchy in the world we have inherited and are building for the future, Perry exposes its mechanisms of domination as a necessary precursor to dismantling it.</p><p>Imani Perry is Hughes-Rogers Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University and author of <i>Prophets of the Hood: Politics and Poetics in Hip Hop</i>, also published by Duke University Press, and <i>More Beautiful and More Terrible: The Embrace and Transcendence of Racial Inequality in the United States</i>."<i>Vexy Thing</i> recontextualizes feminism and patriarchy in an era when both terms have been systemically emptied by market forces; she reminds us that the patriarch is an institutional concept and reminds us of its insidiousness in our everyday life through a devastatingly sharp historical critique, necessarily centering black women as the locus of her conversation." (Julianne Escobedo Shepherd <i>Jezebel</i> 2018-12-13)<br><br>"Using historical examples, narrative vignettes, and meditative interludes, Perry pushes the conventions of academic writing in part to advocate for feminism as critical reading practice rather than doctrine. . . . [She] invite[s] the reader to consider patriarchy not as a parallel structure repeating itself across cultures but rather an iterative and changeable force constituted through its interactions with race, empire, geographic location, and other intersections. Highly recommended. Advanced undergraduates and above." (S. L. Vandermeade <i>Choice</i> 2019-03-01)<br><br>"Perry presents a feminist reading praxis that examines history, theory and academic scholarship to provide the basis for understanding how patriarchy informs our individual and collective selves. This book should be on the shelf of any graduate student working in the fields of feminist scholarship and critical race theory." (Katelan Dunn <i>LSE Review of Books</i> 2019-02-08)<br><br>"What is patriarchy? This question is at the heart of <i>Vexy Thing</i>, but Perry does more than define patriarchy. She names it, identifies it, locates its global reach, examines its historical construction, and explores its present-day impact. <i>Vexy Thing</i> does a lot and in a good way. It is a capacious work of black feminist theory that works through patriarchy&#x2019;s violence to imagine personhood, livability, and a more just world."

As the novel begins, ominous events are taking place throughout North America, but little of it surfaces before the public eye. Set in the not-too-distant future, the story describes a nation that is quietly shifting from a democratic form of government to a form of totalitarianism.

They crafted intricate tools from stone and brewed mind-altering elixirs from honey. Their descendants transformed clay into pottery, wool into clothing, and ashes into cleansers. In ceramic crucibles they won metal from rock, the metals lead to colored glazes and glass. Buildings of brick and mortar enshrined books of parchment and paper. Kings and queens demanded ever more colorful clothing and accessories in order to out-class clod-hoppers and call-girls. Kingdoms rose and fell by the power of saltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal. And the demands of everyday folk for glass and paper and soap stimulated the first round of chemical industrialization. From sulfuric acid to sodium carbonate. From aniline dyes to analgesic drugs. From blasting powder to fertilizers and plastics. In a phrase, From Caveman to Chemist. Your guides on this journey are the four alchemical elements; Fire, Earth, Air and Water. These archetypical characters deliver first-hand accounts of the births of their respective technologies. The spirit of Fire, for example, was born in the first creature to cultivate the flame. This spirit passed from one person to another, from one generation to another, from one millennium to another, arriving at last in the pages of this book. The spirit of Earth taught folks to make tools of stone, the spirit of Air imparted knowledge of units and the spirit of Water began with the invention of spirits. Having traveled the world from age to age, who can say where they will find their next home? Perhaps they will find one in you.</p><p>Kevin Dunn is the Elliott Professor of Chemistry at Hampden-Sydney College, where he teaches the course which inspired this book.

The master of ancient Greek comic drama, Aristophanes combined slapstick, humour and cheerful vulgarity with acute political observations. In <i>The Frogs</i>, written during the Peloponnesian War, Dionysus descends to the Underworld to bring back a poet who can help Athens in its darkest hour, and stages a great debate to help him decide between the traditional wisdom of Aeschylus and the brilliant modernity of Euripides. The clash of generations and values is also the object of Aristophanes' satire in <i>Wasps</i>, in which an old-fashioned father and his loose-living son come to blows and end up in court. And in <i>Women at the Thesmophoria</i>, the famous Greek tragedian Euripides, accused of misogyny, persuades a relative to infiltrate an all-women festival to find out whether revenge is being plotted against him. <br><br> Shomit Dutta's introduction discusses Aristophanes' life, the cultural context of his work and conventions of Greek comedy.

That's why we go to conferences and emulate the latest superstars. But we know we can never live up to those images. Deep down, we know our own limitations, our weaknesses, our faults. We fear that if people knew who we really are, we'd be disqualified from ministry. Not so. Mandy Smith unpacks the biblical paradox that God's strength is revealed through our human weakness. Transparently describing her pastoral journey, Smith shows how vulnerability shapes ministry, through our spiritual practices and relationships, influencing our preaching, teaching and even the nuts and bolts of the daily schedule. Understanding our human constraints makes our ministry more sustainable and guards us against disillusionment and burnout. We don't have to have it all together. Recognizing our weakness makes us rely on God, so our weakness can become a ministry resource. God has called you to lead not as a demigod, but as a human, so the world can see that the church is a place for humans like them.</p><p>Originally from Australia, Mandy Smith is lead pastor of University Christian Church, a campus and neighborhood congregation with its own fair-trade caf� in Cincinnati, Ohio. She is a regular contributor to <em>Leadership Journal</em> and <em>PARSE</em> and the author of <em>Making a Mess and Meeting God</em>. She is also the creator of The Collect, a citywide trash-to-art project. She and her husband live with their two children in a little house where the teapot is always warm.<br><br>David Hansen is pastor of Heritage Community Church in Cincinnati, Ohio. He has also pastored in Montana, the setting for many of the stories in his book <em>The Art of Pastoring: Ministry Without All the Answers</em> (IVP). Hansen is also author of <em>Loving the Church You Lead: Pastoring with Acceptance and Grace</em> (Baker). In 1999, Hansen was awarded an honorary doctor of divinity degree from Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. He has been a contributing editor for <em>Leadership Journal</em>, and is a frequent speaker at pastoral ministry conferences."Mandy Smith has given us a wonderful guide to pastoral well-being and faithful excellence. She has discovered that our limitations are the womb of possibility and that when we are weak, we are strong in God." (Bruce Epperly, Patheos, December 14, 2015)<br><br>"Despite the reference to pastoral ministry in its title, this book is one that should be read much more broadly than just by pastors. While especially vital for pastors, it is no less significant when read by laypeople, as it is a poignant reminder of the humanity of our leaders and of the call for each of us to devote ourselves to the work of the Gospel. Smith?s call to live faithfully within the bounds of our humanness will guide us toward a deeper life together that is both more joyful and more sustainable." (Chris Smith, V3 Church Planting Movement, November 18, 2015)<br><br>"Mandy Smith has packed a lot of freedom for pastors into her book&#x2015;freedom from unrealistic expectations of others and those they impose on themselves. <em>The Vulnerable Pastor</em> creates space and freedom for pastors to embrace honestly their own spiritual journey with God, to engage their struggles, doubts, and dark nights of the soul, and to learn and grow along with those they shepherd. The journey Mandy charts carries enormous potential for enriching their own spiritual journeys as well as deepening their ministries to others. Put simply, she pastors the pastor." (Carolyn Custis James, author of Half the Church and Malestrom)<br><br>"Beautifully written. Irresistibly truthful. <em>The Vulnerable Pastor</em> is a profound reversal of nearly everything you know about being a ministry leader. This book exposes the blind spot that the last one hundred years of copying dog-eat-dog, climb-to-the-top leadership models have missed. Vulnerability is the secret to genuine leadership. If the pastoral vocation is to be revived in the decade to come, this is the first aid kit it will need." (Paul Sparks, coauthor of The New Parish, cofounding director of Parish Collective)<br><br>"It's hard to be both painfully honest and faith filled at the same time, but Mandy Smith does it. And she shows us how shepherding souls requires honest faith and hope and love, even when some pain is involved." (Marshall Shelley, editor, Leadership Journal)<br><br>"No kidding: If I could make one new book magically appear on the bedside table of every minister, priest, deacon and elder in North America, <em>The Vulnerable Pastor</em> would be it. Mandy Smith's wise and hopeful book is timely, a much-needed antidote to the influence of macho leadership run amok, which has wrecked so many pastors and churches. It is also timeless, an important reminder that God's power is made perfect in weakness. If you are a pastor, please read this book; if you have a pastor, please read it with them." (John Pattison, coauthor of Slow Church)<br><br>"To those with the most impossible of 'jobs'&#x2015;our pastors&#x2015;comes a great gift: <em>The Vulnerable Pastor</em>. Here, with great care, Mandy Smith manages to reframe what it means to be a pastor and to infuse it with the life of the gospel. I truly tell you that <em>The Vulnerable Pastor</em> resonated with the core of my being. It not only made being a pastor possible again, it made being a pastor wonderful." (David Fitch, B. R. Lindner Chair of Evangelical Theology, Northern Seminary, author of Prodigal Christianity)<br><br>"While many pastors are convinced that limitations and messes in ministry are a curse, Mandy Smith shows us that it's in these spaces that God seems to do his most transformative work. Mandy finds the rare and beautiful balance of raw-yet-hopeful and humble-yet-confident vulnerability, while extending grace to the people who seem to need it most: pastors. In today's ministry culture, fraught with the perception of perfection, Mandy offers pastors refreshing permission to be human. But most refreshing of all, she doesn't just write about her message. She does what the most effective authors do&#x2015;she lives it too." (J.R. Briggs, pastor, author of Fail and founder of Kairos Partnerships)<br><br>"'A vulnerable pastor' is often an oxymoron. Mandy Smith is not; she is an example of her own book. She asks the right questions and wrestles with the answers&#x2015;her honesty is honest. Her voice is like a breath of fresh air in an airtight, stuffy room. This isn't a book just for pastors but for all of us who want to be 'real' with ourselves, others and God." (Ruth Graham, author of In Every Pew Sits a Broken Heart)<br><br>"The landscape is littered with pastors who feel inadequate. I count myself as one of them. According to Mandy Smith, we are on the brink of an infusion of power if we embrace our weaknesses and count them as a gift from God. In the process, we trust the one God to make up the difference between who we feel we are and what our ministry can become."

In his third volume of meditations on Matthew (chapters 19-25), Erasmo Leiva continues to show Matthew's prose to be not terse so much as economical -- astoundingly so given its depth. The lay reader can derive great profit from reading this. Each short meditation comments on a verse or two, pointing to some facet of the text not immediately apparent, but rich with meaning.<p>Leiva's work is scholarly but eminently approachable by the lay reader. The tone is very much of "taste and see how good the Lord is" and an invitation of "friend, come up higher!". The goal of the book is to help the reader experience the heat of the divine heart and the light of the divine Word.</p><p>Leiva comments on the Greek text, demonstrating nuances in the text that defy translation. He uses numerous quotes from the Fathers and the Liturgy of the Church to demonstrate the way the Tradition has lived and read the Word of God.

McWilliam, Ph.D. Copyright� 2010 by Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co. All rights reserved. No part of this excerpt may be reproduced or reprinted without permission in writing from the publisher.</p><p>The purposes of assessment were described in Chapter 5, and the case has been made for an innovative method to determine a family's functional needs. Current standardized methods do not determine these needs. First, some method is needed to identify functional goals or outcomes, otherwise known as target behaviors. Functionality of child outcomes can be thought of as addressing participation or engagement needs, addressing independence needs, and addressing social-relationship needs. Throughout this book, the importance of these three domains is stressed. Second, family priorities need to be reflected in the IFSP. Third, outcomes should be broad enough to cover a variety of ways of displaying the target behavior yet narrow enough to know what is really being addressed. Fourth, the strategies or action steps should aim directly at the function problem. Strategies such as using oral-motor exercises might be employed to address an outcome related to eating and swallowing, but a more direct approach is to teach a child to chew and swallow. The rule is <i>teach first.</i> Fifth, the process for developing IFSPs needs to foster investment by caregivers other than the family, such as child care providers, in the outcomes. The Routines-Based Interview (RBI) is a method that addresses these five needs.</p><p><b>Confluence of Two Models</b></p><p>The RBI is central to two models that have become quite widespread in the past 10 years. It was first described in <i>Family-Centered Intervention Planning: A Routines- Based Approach</i> (McWilliam, 1992), which was written primarily for helping classroom-based staff to be family friendly. The premise was that planning with families in a way that addressed families' true concerns for their children, both at home and in the classroom, would help overcome the barrier of not seeing families for as long a time each week and on their home turf. Many of the principles from the co-ops where we tried out this and other practices have evolved into the individualizing inclusion model of classroom-based services (Wolery, 1997). That model hinges on the RBI as an assessment of the ecological congruence between a child's abilities and the classroom environment. This assessment leads directly to the development of the IFSP or individualized education program (IEP). Once a list of functional behaviors is identified, all services are provided in the classroom to ensure teamwork between classroom staff and specialists such as speech-language pathologists, itinerant special educators, occupational therapists, and physical therapists. The specialists' responsibility is to make their intervention suggestions fit into classroom routines, and teachers' responsibility is to embed those interventions into routines. The model hinges on functional outcomes or goals, which come from the RBI.</p><p>By now, it will be clear that the RBI is also central to the model of early intervention in natural environments. Again, the functionality of the child- and <b>family-level outcomes</b> in situations where the family is receiving home- and community-based services, including consultation to child care, makes the model of service delivery and the home and child care visits go more smoothly. As will be demonstrated throughout this book, the RBI is the linchpin for many of the other practices I recommend be employed in early intervention.</p><p><b>Research on the RBI</b></p><p>We recently completed the first study on the efficacy of using the RBI for IFSP development (McWilliam, Casey, &amp; Sims, in 2009). Sixteen families were randomly assigned either to receive the RBI or to receive the business-as-usual IFSP development process. An RBI produced better outcomes than did the traditional approach to IFSP development. The families in the RBI group were more satisfied with the IFSP development process than were the families in the contrast group, and the contrast group had more variable responses. As expected, the number of outcomes was greater as a result of the RBI than as a result of the standard process. Finally, outcomes written as a result of the RBI were more functional than outcomes written as a result of the standard process.</p><p><b> What Are Routines?</b></p><p>In this model, <b>routines</b> are not activities the professional implements with the family. Instead, they are naturally occurring activities happening with some regularity, including caregiving events and simply hanging-out times. As reluctant as I might be to admit this, not everything happens in routines. Hence, at the beginning of the interview, we ask about major concerns first. In fact, conversations about routines do lead to many concerns beyond what happens in routines. Therefore, a Routines-Based Interview is not as circumscribed as might be thought. Another safeguard comes at the end of the interview, when the family is asked if anything else should be discussed.</p><p><b>Routines-Based Interview</b></p><p>In the original manual (McWilliam, 1992), five stages of the RBI were described. They are presented in the following sections.</p><p><b>Preparation of Families and Staff</b></p><p>If the child spends more than about 15 hours a week in child care, the child care provider should be included in the interview. If this person can be present at the same meeting as the family, the ideal situation is achieved. Often, however, caregivers and families are not free at the same time, in which case child care providers should be interviewed before the family. That allows the interviewer to convey what the child care provider has reported, and the family has all the information for making their decisions.</p><p>In preparing for the interview, the main point to convey to families and classroom staff is to think about what routines (times of day, everyday events and activities) they have and, for each one, consider the following points:</p><ol><li>What the expectations are </li><li>What the child does </li><li>How well that routine is working for the family or, for classroom routines, for the Child</li></ol><p>The Family Preparation Form (Harbin, 2005; McWilliam, 1992) is provided in Appendix 6.1 to help families get ready for the interview.</p><p>The other preparation points are logistical: where, when, who, and so forth. Families should be warned that the RBI lasts for 2 hours and that it is quite an intense conversation, so it works best if there are few distractions. This could include having someone else watch the child, if that is convenient for the family. This request is not made callously; the RBI is done only every 6 months and is quite different from a regular home visit. Some interviewers are self-conscious about making this request, but families appreciate being warned more than being sabotaged. Of course, some families are not able to make arrangements, which is fine.</p><p><b>The Interview</b></p><p>The interview is a semi structured interview that must contain the following critical features for it to be considered a "Routines-Based Interview (RBI)":</p><ol><li><i>Main concerns</i>. At the beginning of the interview, the family should be asked what their main concerns are, so these can be listed and elaborated upon as the conversation moves to the day-to-day life of the family. Often families' main concerns are about walking and talking. Traditionally, that is where the outcome/goal selection ended, with a walking outcome and a talking outcome&#x2014;no other child target behaviors and no family-level outcomes/goals. So, whereas the answer to the main concerns question historically has led straight into outcome/goal development, in this approach it is merely the beginning, to determine what is on the family's mind.<br><br></li><li><i>Go through the day</i>. As mentioned above, the structure of the interview is the family's progression through a typical day. To move from one time of day to another, the family is asked what happens next, rather than assuming what routines a family has and in what order they occur. During the discussion about each time of day, the interviewer attempts to find the answers to the following six questions: <ol><li>What everyone (both parents, siblings, other classroom children) is doing at that time </li><li>What the child does </li><li>The child's engagement </li><li>The child's independence </li><li>The child's <b>social relationships</b></li><li>The family's satisfaction with the routine</li></ol><p>The discussion is detailed enough for the interviewer to be able, figuratively, to paint a picture of the routine and to be able to determine what the family would like to happen differently at that time of the day. Depending on how much detail the parent gives in answer to an open-ended question such as, "What does breakfast time look like?", the interviewer might need to ask many detailed follow-up questions to be able to paint that picture. The goal is to find out what else the family would like to happen during that time of day&#x2014;something that gets a star, as described next.<br></p></li><li><i>Star concerns</i>. When the family mentions something a) not going well, b) they would like to be different, c) they think the child will be able to do next, or d) that raises a red flag for the interviewer, the interviewer makes a note of it and puts a star next to it. This helps with retrieval during the recap, described below. An example of something not going well might be the parent's saying, "She runs away every time I take her out of the car. That worries me to death." An example of something the parent would like to be different might be, "I'm not sure I have enough toys on the floor to entice him to crawl." An example of something the child might be able to do next might be, "She's doing really well when we go for a walk. It's a fun time. I guess the next skill will be for her to be able to step up and down at the curb with just one hand held." An example of a red flag might be, "Bedtime is no problem. I tell him he'll get a spanking if he doesn't lie there quietly." The parent might not think there is a problem, but the interviewer sees this as an opportunity to offer ideas for managing bedtime.<br><br></li><li><i>Satisfaction ratings</i>. At the end of the discussion of every home routine, the interviewer asks for a judgment by the parent of how well that time of day is going&#x2014;how happy the parent is with that time of day&#x2014;on a scale of 1&#x2013;5. If discussing school routines with a classroom teacher or child care provider, the concluding question is how well that time of day is working for the child&#x2014;a goodness-of-fit question&#x2014;on a scale of 1&#x2013;5.<br><br></li><li><i>Worry and change questions</i>. Once the whole day is completed or time is running out (e.g., 1.5 hours have elapsed), the family is asked two questions:<ol><li> When you lie awake at night, worrying, what is it you worry about? </li><li> If there's anything you could change in your life, what would it be?</li></ol><br></li><li><i>Recap</i>. This is the summary of the important information emanating from the interview. It will include <i>child-level needs</i>, such as for the child to sit independently at different times of the day; <i>child-related family needs</i>, such as the family's wanting to learn a way to figure out a child's preferences at meals and playtimes; or <i>family-level needs</i>, such as the parents making time for each other without the child. The interviewer quickly goes through all the starred items. Nothing is written down at this point; this is just a summing up.<br><br></li><li><i>Family chooses outcomes</i>. After the recap, the family is asked to start listing the things they would like to work on, including the three types of needs mentioned above. If necessary, the interviewer shows the family the notes, particularly the starred items.<br><br></li><li><i>Priority order</i>. Once the family has finished selecting outcomes and goals, as long as there is a minimum of six of them, they are asked to number them in order of importance.</li></ol><p>The Protocol for the Routines-Based Interview (McWilliam, 2009a), available from Siskin Children's Institute (http://www.siskinresearch.org), is a tool to help guide the interviewer through the process and to document what is said. Figure 6.2 provides common questions, in order. This list can be photocopied and used as a reference during the interview.</p><p><b>Outcome Writing</b></p><p>Once outcomes have been identified, the service coordinator needs to put the <b>RBI outcomes</b> on to the IFSP. The service coordinator consults with other team members about the wording of outcomes, although the parent's words are often enough. Writing functional IFSPs and IEPs is discussed in Chapter 7. </p><p><b>Strategies and Review</b></p><p>At the same time that the service coordinator consults with other team members about the wording of outcomes or goals as necessary, he or she also consults with them about strategies. Only one or two strategies are needed for each outcome at this early stage. It is unreasonable to expect that teaching plans, for example, can be developed without knowing more about the child's functioning. Reviews occur at least every 6 months, but should occur as often as needed. </p><p>To review the structure of the RBI, families report on their routines first, and child care providers or teachers report on classroom routines second. Team members other than the interviewer who might be present can ask questions and provide information during discussions of routines, but they do not have a separate decontextualized reporting time. All professionals withhold giving advice, because as soon as they do so it changes the dynamics. The family loses confidence and seeks reassurance about what they do during their routines. If the family does specifically ask for suggestions, the interviewer says, "That's a very good question. Let me write it down, and another team member or I will be sure to answer that for you later." </p><p><b>Interview Strategies</b></p><p>Conducting a good interview requires knowing child development, knowing family functioning, and having good people skills. This leads to appropriate questions within the structure presented above. The following interview behaviors are critical for the success of an RBI.</p><ul><li>Be natural and as informal as is appropriate. </li><li>Put the parent at ease with this naturalness and informality. </li><li>Look the parent in the eye when he or she is talking. </li><li>Avoid the use of jargon; if the parent uses jargon, ask what he or she means. </li><li>Nod and in other ways affirm what the parent is saying. </li><li>From time to time, express admiration for what the parent does with his or her family. </li><li>Express understanding about how the parent might feel (e.g., "I bet you feel really good about that," or "I bet that's really frustrating"); more safely, ask the parent how he or she feels. </li><li>Place papers flat so the parent can see what is being written&#x2014;distance notwithstanding. </li><li>Find a point of personal contact and very briefly use "self-disclosure" (any behavior or verbalization that reveals personal i...</li></ul></p><h2>Supervision in Early Childhood Education (Early Childhood Education Series)</h2><p><p>Every early care and education program deserves a qualified and competent supervisor.

What could we possibly learn that we haven't seen or heard before? If you're looking for an Advent study of a different slant, While We Wait: Living the Questions of Advent offers new ways of connecting the story with your own questions of faith and approaches an all-too-familiar narrative from perspectives we may have missed. You'll read about biblical figures mentioned in passing in the ""original"" Advent. Somewhat surprisingly, Tamar, Ruth, Mary, Zechariah, Elizabeth, and the Magi ask questions that resonate with contemporary Christians. ""I hope While We Wait will help people who don't want to gloss over their questions about the Christmas story,"" writes Redding. ""This book examines Advent as a journey in which God seeks us at many levels of our understanding and spiritual willingness. It allows for real-life struggles and questions as a part of Advent's spiritual exploration.""Designed as a complete Advent study, this book offers readers or groups * unique perspectives on the events of Christmas * complete plans for small-group sessions * a fifth session for the week of Epiphany * daily scripture reading and reflection questions * an introduction to the spiritual discipline of breath prayer <p>What are the questions you bring to God this season?</p></p><p>Mary Lou Redding is Editorial Director of The Upper Room daily devotional guide.

The situation, I must say, is anything but pleasant. I'm someone who <i>writes</i> stories, not someone who tells them. And even <i>that</i> isn't something I do on demand. The last time anyone asked me to tell him a story, it was my son. That was a year ago. I told him something about a fairy and a ferret--I don't even remember what exactly--and within two minutes he was fast asleep. But the situation is fundamentally different. Because my son doesn't have a beard, or a pistol. Because my son asked for the story nicely, and this man is simply trying to rob me of it.I try to explain to the bearded man that if he puts his pistol away it will only work in his favor, in our favor. It's hard to think up a story with the barrel of a loaded pistol pointed at your head. But the guy insists. "In this country," he explains, "if you want something, you have to use force." He just got here from Sweden, and in Sweden it's completely different. Over there, if you want something, you ask politely, and most of the time you get it. But not in the stifling, muggy Middle East. All it takes is one week in this place to figure out how things work--or rather, how things don't work. The Palestiniansasked for a state, nicely. Did they get one? The hell they did. So they switched to blowing up kids on buses, and people started listening. The settlers wanted a dialogue. Did anyone pick up on it? No way. So they started getting physical, pouring hot oil on the border patrolmen, and suddenly they had an audience. In this country, might makes right, and it doesn't matter if it's about politics, or economics or a parking space. Brute force is the only language we understand.Sweden, the place the bearded guy made aliya from, is progressive, and is way up there in quite a few areas. Sweden isn't just ABBA or IKEA or the Nobel Prize. Sweden is a world unto itself, and whatever they have, they got by peaceful means. In Sweden, if he'd gone to the Ace of Base soloist, knocked on her door, and asked her to sing for him, she'd have invited him in and made him a cup of tea. Then she'd have pulled out her acoustic guitar from under the bed and played for him. All this with a smile! But here? I mean, if he hadn't been flashing a pistol I'd have thrown him out right away. Look, I try to reason. "'Look' yourself," the bearded guy grumbles, and cocks his pistol. "It's either a story or a bullet between the eyes." I see my choices are limited. The guy means business. "Two people are sitting in a room," I begin. "Suddenly, there's a knock on the door." The bearded guy stiffens, and for a moment I think maybe the story's getting to him, but it isn't. He's listening to something else. There's a knock on the door. "Open it," he tells me, "and don't try anything. Get rid of whoever it is, and do it fast, or this is going to end badly."The young man at the door is doing a survey. He has a few questions. Short ones. About the high humidity here in summer, and how it affects my disposition. I tell him I'm not interested but he pushes his way inside anyway."Who's that?" he asks me, pointing at the bearded guy. "That's my nephew from Sweden," I lie. "His father died in an avalanche and he's here for the funeral. We're just going over the will. Could you please respect our privacy and leave?" "C'mon, man," the pollster says, and pats me on the shoulder. "It's just a few questions. Give a guy a chance to earn a few bucks. They pay me per respondent." He flops down on the sofa, clutching his binder. The Swede takes a seat next to him. I'm still standing, trying to sound like I mean it. "I'm asking you to leave," I tell him. "Your timing is way off." "Way off, eh?" He opens the plastic binder and pulls out a big revolver. "Why's my timing off? 'Cause I'm darker? 'Cause I'm not good enough? When it comes to Swedes, you've got all the time in the world. But for a Moroccan, for a war veteran who left pieces of his spleen behind in Lebanon, you can't spare a fucking minute." I try to reason with him, to tell him it's not that way at all, that he'd simply caught me at a delicate point in my conversation with the Swede. But the pollster raises his revolver to his lips and signals me to shut up. <i>"Vamos,"</i> he says. "Stop making excuses. Sit down over there, and out with it." "Out with what?" I ask. The truth is, now I'm pretty uptight. The Swede has a pistol too. Things might get out of hand. East is east and west is west, and all that. Different mentalities. Or else the Swede could lose it, simply because he wants the story all to himself. Solo. "Don't get me started," the pollster warns. "I have a short fuse. Out with the story--and make it quick." "Yeah," the Swede chimes in, and pulls out his piece too. I clear my throat, and start all over again. "Three people are sitting in a room." "And no 'Suddenly, there's a knock on the door,'" the Swede announces. The pollster doesn't quite get it, but plays along with him. "Get going," hesays. "And no knocking on the door. Tell us something else. Surprise us."I stop short, and take a deep breath. Both of them are staring at me. How do I always get myself into these situations? I bet things like this never happen to Amos Oz or David Grossman. Suddenly there's a knock on the door. Their gaze turns menacing. I shrug. It's not about me. There's nothing in my story to connect it to that knock. "Get rid of him," the pollster orders me. "Get rid of him, whoever it is." I open the door just a crack. It's a pizza delivery guy. "Are you Keret?" he asks. "Yes," I say, "but I didn't order a pizza." "It says here Fourteen Zamenhoff Street," he snaps, pointing at the printed delivery slip and pushing his way inside. "So what," I say, "I didn't order a pizza." "Family size," he insists. "Half pineapple, half anchovy. Prepaid. Credit card. Just gimme my tip and I'm outta here." "Are you here for a story too?" the Swede interrogates. "What story?" the pizza guy asks, but it's obvious he's lying. He's not very good at it. "Pull it out," the pollster prods. "C'mon, out with the pistol already." "I don't have a pistol," the pizza guy admits awkwardly, and draws a cleaver out from under his cardboard tray. "But I'll cut him into julienne strips unless he coughs up a good one, on the double."The three of them are on the sofa--the Swede on the right, then the pizza guy, then the pollster. "I can't do it like this," I tell them. "I can't get a story going with the three of you here and your weapons and all that. Go take a walk around the block, and by the time you get back, I'll have something for you." "The asshole's gonna call the cops," the pollster tells the Swede. "What's he thinking, that we were born yesterday?" "C'mon, give us one and we'll be on our way," the pizza guy begs. "A short one. Don't be so anal. Things aretough, you know. Unemployment, suicide bombings, Iranians. People are hungry for something else. What do you think brought law-abiding guys like us this far? We're desperate, man, desperate."I clear my throat and start again. "Four people are sitting in a room. It's hot. They're bored. The air conditioner's on the blink. One of them asks for a story. The second one joins in, then the third ..." "That's not a story," the pollster protests. "That's an eyewitness report. It's exactly what's happening here right now. Exactly what we're trying to run away from. Don't you go and dump reality on us like a garbage truck. Use your imagination, man, create, invent, take it all the way."I nod and start again. "A man is sitting in a room, all by himself. He's lonely. He's a writer. He wants to write a story. It's been a long time since he wrote his last story, and he misses it. He misses the feeling of creating something out of something. That's right--something out of something. Because something out of nothing is when you make something up out of thin air, in which case it has no value. Anybody can do that. But something out of something means it was really there the whole time, inside you, and you discover it as part of something new, that's never happened before. The man decides to write a story about the situation. Not the political situation and not the social situation either. He decides to write a story about the human situation, the human condition. The human condition the way he's experiencing it right now. But he draws a blank. No story presents itself. Because the human condition the way he's experiencing it right now doesn't seem to be worth a story, and he's just about to give up when suddenly ..." "I warned you already," the Swede interrupts me."No knock on the door." "I've got to," I insist. "Without a knock on the door there's no story." "Let him," the pizza guy says softly. "Give him some slack. You want a knock on the door? Okay, have your knock on the door. Just so long as it brings us a story."Copyright � 2010 by Etgar Keret</p><h2>A String of Beads (The Jane Whitefield Series, 2)</h2><p>From the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Thomas Perry, <i>A String of Beads</i> is an addictive, brilliantly suspenseful novel featuring rescue artist Jane Whitefield, who has spent two decades protecting innocent victims on the run.<br><br>A year after getting shot on a job that took a dangerous turn, Jane has settled into the quiet life of a suburban housewife in Amherst, New York or so she thinks. One morning, coming back from a long run, Jane is met by an unusual sight: the female leaders of the eight Seneca clans parked in her driveway in two black cars. They have come to her with an unusual request. Jane&#x2019;s childhood friend from the reservation is wanted by the police for the murder of a local white man, and he has fled. The clan mothers believe that Jane is the only one who can find him. So Jane sets out to retrace a journey she took with Jimmy when they were fourteen years old, and soon realizes that the police aren&#x2019;t the only ones after her childhood friend. As the chase intensifies, the number of people caught up in this deadly plot grows, and Jane is the only one who can protect those endangered by it.</p><p><b>Thomas Perry</b> is the bestselling author of over twenty novels, including the Edgar Award-winning <i>The Butcher's Boy</i>, <i>Poison Flower</i>, and <i>The Boyfriend</i>.

She pulled close to the garage<br>doorway, got out, and walked to the front of her car.<br><br> Janie?&#x201d;<br><br>Jane turned her head and saw a dark-skinned man about her age wearing blue work pants, steel-toed boots, and a gray work shirt with an embroidered patch above the pocket that said RAY. Jane stepped up and hugged him. It&#x2019;s great to see you, Ray. I was afraid you would be on vacation or something.&#x201d;<br><br> No, the guys who work for me get vacations. I&#x2019;m always here, like the doorknob. Got a car problem?&#x201d;<br><br> I wondered if you could do the scheduled maintenance on my car you know, oil, filter, lube, check and replace belts and hoses and then keep it here safe for at least a week or so.&#x201d;<br><br> I&#x2019;d be glad to. You staying around here?&#x201d;<br><br> I thought I&#x2019;d go on a hike, like we used to when we were kids.&#x201d;<br><br>Ray Snow&#x2019;s brows knitted. You trying to find Jimmy?&#x201d;<br><br>Jane looked around to see if anyone else was in earshot. She smiled and said, Not me. That&#x2019;s the police&#x2019;s job. I wouldn&#x2019;t want to get involved.&#x201d;<br><br> Well, that&#x2019;s good.

We fail to capture the power of forgiveness because we are afraid of it, because we have grown comfortable in our familiar wounds, or because we are sinfully stubborn. But the power is there waiting for us. <br><br>The lesson is simple: Give forgiveness and you will unleash a flood of grace on yourself and on those around you. When you clench your fists and grit your teeth in anger toward someone, you have no room in your heart for God to place His hand in yours. Replace your clenched fist with an open hand and watch as God fills your soul to overflowing. <br><br> This little book, and the twelve real-life stories in it, will help you capture the power of forgiveness in your life. Because everybody needs to forgive somebody.</p><p>Dr. Allen Hunt is a nationally known speaker and best-selling author. His books include: Confessions of a Mega-Church Pastor: How I Discovered the Hidden Treasures of the Catholic Church; Everybody Needs to Forgive Somebody; and Nine Words: A Bible Study to Help You Become the Best-Version-of-Yourself. <br><p> Allen stepped aside July 1, 2007, as Senior Pastor at Mount Pisgah, a congregation serving more than 15,000 persons each week through all of its ministries in Alpharetta, Georgia, outside Atlanta. While at Mount Pisgah, Allen helped to develop comprehensive ministries with children and students as well as a Christian School with over 1200 students; a Beacon of Hope pregnancy resource center; and the Summit Counseling Center. <br></p><p> On January 6 2008, on the Feast of the Epiphany, Allen converted to Catholicism.

It turns out that the Neanderthals&#x2019; behavior was surprisingly modern: they buried the dead, cared for the sick, hunted large animals in their prime, harvested seafood, and communicated with spoken language. Meanwhile, advances in DNA technologies are compelling us to reassess the Neanderthals&#x2019; place in our own past.<br><br> For hundreds of thousands of years, Neanderthals evolved in Europe parallel to <em>Homo sapiens</em> evolving in Africa, and, when both species made their first forays into Asia, the Neanderthals may even have had the upper hand. In this important volume, Dimitra Papagianni and Michael A. Morse compile the first full chronological narrative of the Neanderthals&#x2019; dramatic existence&#x2015;from their evolution in Europe to their expansion to Siberia, their subsequent extinction, and ultimately their revival in popular novels, cartoons, cult movies, and television commercials. 77 illustrations, 20 in color</p><p><p><strong>Dimitra Papagianni</strong> has taught courses on the Neanderthals at the Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, and Bath.

Perhaps you are the unwitting victim of a psychic vampire. Want to know more? In this his second book, Konstantinos explores the folklore surrounding the blood-drinking vampire and, more importantly, exposes the threat of 20th century vampires which feed on psychic energy. I found this amalgam of stories from the past with Konstantinos&#39; experiences in the present appealing to both the folklorist and the occultist sides of my curiosity. Konstantinos&#39; theories will be considered controversial by many, but I don&#39;t feel that they can be summarily dismissed.When I first saw the title of Konstantinos' manuscript, <i>Vampires</i>, I was rather hesitant to even look at it. The scientific side of me was quite doubtful. After all, vampires are fiction, aren't they? <br> <br>No. They're not. <br> <br>Konstantinos presents undeniable proof that vampires existed...and still exist today. He reveals the history of vampires throughout the world. Virtually every culture has records and myths of them. He then reveals historic vampires. <br> <br><i>Vampires</i> discusses the four types of vampires that walk this earth. You'll learn how to identify them and discover what they do. <i>Vampires</i> also gives you explicit instructions on how to protect yourself from vampiric attacks. <br> <br>If you are a doubter, as I was, this book is a must. The facts become clear: vampires are a literal reality. You will read letters from <i>real</i> vampires who tell what their lives are actually like. This is more exciting than any fictional interview with a vampire because it is real! <br> <br>Whether you believe in vampires or are a doubter, <i>Vampires</i> is a must! <br></p><h2>Spells and Scones (A Magical Bakery Mystery)</h2><p><b>There's a body in the bookshop in this latest novel from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Magical Bakery mysteries...</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> When the bookshop next to the Honeybee Bakery hosts a signing for a Savannah radio celebrity's new self-help book, magical baker Katie Lightfoot is happy to provide some delectable desserts.

It is also the most meaningful creation story that humans have ever found."-Bill Nye</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>Sparked by a controversial debate in February 2014, Bill Nye has set off on an energetic campaign to spread awareness of evolution and the powerful way it shapes our lives. In <i>Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation</i>, he explains why race does not really exist; evaluates the true promise and peril of genetically modified food; reveals how new species are born, in a dog kennel and in a London subway; takes a stroll through 4.5 billion years of time; and explores the new search for alien life, including aliens right here on Earth.</p><p>With infectious enthusiasm, Bill Nye shows that evolution is much more than a rebuttal to creationism; it is an essential way to understand how nature works-and to change the world.

I was about seven years old, and I watched them&nbsp;&#x2026; all day. That Sunday, I had read the &#x201c;Ripley&#x2019;s Believe It or Not&#x201d; column in <i>The Washington Post</i>, which claimed, &#x201c;The Bumblebee: Considering its size, shape, and wingspan, is an aerodynamic misfit&#x2014;which should be unable to fly!&#x201d; It was frustrating, because here they were flying. I got caught up in the details. Their wings looked like decoration, no more useful than a store-bought bow glued to a gift. I looked closely at my mother&#x2019;s azalea flowers&#x2014;so many delicate parts. Somehow, the bees were able to get in there, fill their pollen baskets from the flowers, and fly away again and again.</p> <p>How did bees learn to do all that? Where did they come from? Where did the flowers come from? Come to think of it, how did any of us get here? Why did Ripley&#x2019;s have it so obviously wrong? I was getting pulled into something much larger than myself. The yearning to know about nature and where or how we fit in is deep within all of us. As I learned about evolution and descent by natural selection, the answers fell into place.</p> <p>We are all aware that evolution happens, because we all have parents. Many of us have, or will have, children. We see the effects of heredity up close and personal. We&#x2019;ve also experienced firsthand what Charles Darwin called descent with modification: the way that an entire population of living things can change from generation to generation. Think about the food grown on farms. For about twelve thousand years, exploiting the phenomenon of evolution, humans have been able to modify plants through a process known as artificial selection. In wheat farming and horse racing we call it breeding. Darwin realized that breeding (and domesticating) plants and animals involves exactly the same process that occurs naturally in evolution, only accelerated with the help of humans. This natural process produced you and me.</p> <p>Once you become aware&#x2014;once you see how evolution works&#x2014;so many familiar aspects of the world take on new significance. The affectionate nuzzling of a dog, the annoying bite of a mosquito, the annual flu shot: All are direct consequences of evolution. As you read this book, I hope you will also come away with a deeper appreciation for the universe and our place within it. We are the results of billions of years of cosmic events that led to the cozy, habitable planet we live on.</p> <p>We experience evolution every day in our culture as well. People everywhere are fascinated with other people. That&#x2019;s why we have sidewalk caf�s, televisions, and gossip magazines. We interact to produce more of us for future generations. People are fascinated with their bodies. Turn on the television to any channel. If it&#x2019;s youth-oriented music programming, you&#x2019;ll see advertisements for skin medicines to make you look healthy, for deodorants to modify your natural scents, and for hair and makeup products to render you more attractive to a potential mate. If it&#x2019;s a staid news channel, you&#x2019;ll see ads for improving your breathing, your bones, and, of course, your sexual performance. None of these products would be produced were we not walking, talking products of evolution.</p> <p>We are all so much alike, because we are all human. But it goes deeper than that. Every species you&#x2019;ll encounter on Earth is, near as we can tell, chemically the same inside. We are all descended from a common ancestor. We are shaped by the same forces and factors that influence every other living thing, and yet we emerged as something unique. Among the estimated 16 million species on Earth, we alone have the ability to comprehend the process that brought us here. Any way you reckon it, evolution is inspiring.</p> <p>Despite all of that, a great number of people in many parts of the world&#x2014;even in well-educated parts of the developed world&#x2014;are resistant or hostile to the idea of evolution. Even in places like Pennsylvania and Kentucky, here in the United States, the whole idea of evolution is overwhelming, confusing, frightening, and even threatening to many individuals. I can understand why. It&#x2019;s an enormous process, unfolding over times that dwarf a human lifespan&#x2014;across billions of years and in every part of the world. And it&#x2019;s profoundly humbling. As I learned more about evolution, I realized that from nature&#x2019;s point of view, you and I ain&#x2019;t such a big deal. Humans are just another species on this planet trying to make a go of it, trying to pass our genes into the future, just like chrysanthemums, muskrats, sea jellies, poison ivy&nbsp;&#x2026; and bumblebees.</p> <p>Many people who are troubled by evolution want to suppress teaching the whole concept of descent through natural selection in schools. Others try to push it aside or dilute it by casting doubt on the established science that supports it. State education standards allow the teaching of fictitious alternatives to evolution in Texas, Louisiana, and Tennessee. Even though the people who support these curricula live lives that are enriched in many ways by science and engineering (everything from running water and abundant food to television and the Internet) they avoid the exploration of evolution, because it reminds us all that humankind may not be that special in nature&#x2019;s scheme. What happens to other species also happens to us.</p> <p>I continually remind people what is at stake here. Our understanding of evolution came to us by exactly the same method of scientific discovery that led to printing presses, polio vaccines, and smartphones. Just as mass and motion are fundamental ideas in physics, and the movement of tectonic plates is a fundamental idea in geology, evolution is <i>the</i> fundamental idea in all of life science. Evolution has essential practical applications in agriculture, environmental protection, medicine, and public health. What would the deniers have us do? Ignore all the scientific discoveries that make our technologically driven world possible, things like the ability to rotate crops, pump water, generate electricity, and broadcast baseball?</p> <p>Even the theological objections to evolution stand on shaky ground. For the last century and a half, ever since the publication of Darwin&#x2019;s <i>On the Origin of Species</i> in 1859, many people have come to believe that evolution is in conflict with their religious beliefs. At the same time, many people around the world who hold deep religious convictions see no conflict between their spiritual beliefs and their scientific understanding of evolution. So the naysayers are not only casting doubt on science and nonbelievers; they are also ignoring the billions of non-conflicted believers around the world, dismissing their views as unworthy.</p> <p>I&#x2019;ll admit that the discovery of evolution is humbling, but it is also empowering. It transforms our relationship to the life around us. Instead of being outsiders watching the natural world go by, we are insiders. We are part of the process; we are the exquisite result of billions of years of natural research and development.</p> <p>Frankly, my concern is not so much for the deniers of evolution as it is for their kids. We cannot address the problems facing humankind today without science&#x2014;both the body of scientific knowledge and, more important, the process. Science is the way in which we know nature and our place within it.</p> <p>Like any useful scientific theory, evolution enables us to make predictions about what we observe in nature. Since it was developed in the nineteenth century, the theory itself has also evolved, by which I mean that it&#x2019;s been refined and expanded. Some of the most wonderful aspects and consequences of evolution have been discovered only recently. This is in stark contrast to creationism, which offers a static view of the world, one that cannot be challenged or tested with reason. And because it cannot make predictions, it cannot lead to new discoveries, new medicines, or new ways to feed all of us.</p> <p>Evolutionary theory takes us into the future. As the foundation of biology, evolution informs big questions about emerging agricultural and medical technologies. Should we genetically modify more of our foods? Should we pursue cloning and genetic engineering to improve human health? There is no way to make sense of these issues outside of an evolutionary context. As an engineer trained in the U.S., I look at the assault on evolution&#x2014;which is actually an assault on science overall&#x2014;as much more than an intellectual issue; for me, it&#x2019;s personal. I feel strongly that we need the young people of today to become the scientists and the engineers of tomorrow so that my native United States continues to be a world leader in discovery and innovation. If we suppress science in this country, we are headed for trouble.</p> <p>Evolutionary theory also takes us into the past, offering a compelling case study of the collaborative and cumulative way that great scientific discoveries are made. In some sense the concept of evolution can be traced to the Greek philosopher Anaximander. In the sixth century BC, after evaluating fossils, he speculated that life had begun with fishlike animals living in the ocean. He had no theory of how one species gave rise to another, however, nor did he have an explanation of how Earth acquired its stunning biodiversity. Nobody would, for another two millennia. Ultimately, the mechanism of evolution was discovered by two men at very nearly the same time: Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace.</p> <p>You&#x2019;ve probably heard a great deal about Darwin. You may not have heard so much about Wallace. He was a naturalist who spent a great deal of time in the field studying and collecting specimens of flora and fauna. He traveled in the Amazon River basin and in what is now Malaysia. Through his far-flung geographic and intellectual explorations, Wallace formulated his theory of evolution independent of Darwin, and described an important aspect of the evolutionary process, often still referred to as the &#x201c;Wallace effect&#x201d; (more about that in chapter 12). Wallace recognized humans as just one part of a much broader living world. Quoting from his 1869 book <i>The Malay Archipelago</i>, &#x201c;&#x2026; trees and fruits, no less than the varied productions of the animal kingdom, do not appear to be organized with the exclusive reference to the use and convenience of man&#x2026;&#x201d; In Victorian England, such a point of view was controversial to say the least.</p> <p>Darwin had the earlier start. Wallace was just eight years old in 1831 when the twenty-two-year-old Darwin had a remarkable opportunity as an energetic young man to go to sea aboard the HMS<i> Beagle</i>. He realized that if humans could turn wolves into dogs, then new species could come into existence by the same means naturally. He also saw that populations do not grow and grow indefinitely, because their environment will always have limits on the resources available. Darwin connected these ideas by observing that living things produce more offspring than can survive. The individuals compete for resources in their respective ecosystems, and the individuals that are born or sprout with favorable variations have a better shot at survival than their siblings. He realized that, left unchecked, the process of natural selection would result in the great diversity of living things that he would go on to observe.</p> <p>Recognizing the two scientists&#x2019; convergent views, colleagues arranged for Wallace and Darwin to present a paper together at a meeting of the Linnaean Society in London in 1858. The paper was based on a letter that Wallace had written to Darwin, along with an abstract for a paper that Darwin had written in 1842. The revolutionary impact of the joint presentation was not immediately obvious to all of those in attendance. Thomas Bell, the president of the Linnaean Society, infamously reported that no important scientific breakthroughs had occurred that year: &#x201c;The year which has passed has not, indeed, been marked by any of those striking discoveries which at once revolutionize, so to speak, the department of science on which they bear&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>The publication of <i>On the Origin of Species</i> in 1859 created a sensation and proved President Bell spectacularly wrong. It also made Darwin far more famous than Wallace, as Darwin remains to this day. His ability to articulate the theory of evolution is still astonishing. <i>On the Origin of Species</i> remains a remarkable and remarkably readable book, readily available in hardback, paperback, and online a century and a half later. In it, Darwin gives us example after example of evolution and explains the means by which it happens, providing both the facts and the mechanism in one volume.</p> <p>Evolution is one of the most powerful and important ideas ever developed in the history of science. It describes all of life on Earth. It describes any system in which things compete with each other for resources, whether those things are microbes in your body, trees in a rain forest, or even software programs in a computer. It is also the most reasonable creation story that humans have ever found. When religions disagree about just creation, there is nothing to do but argue. When two scientists disagree about evolution, they confer with colleagues, develop theories, collect evidence, and arrive at a more complete understanding. Every question leads to new answers, new discoveries, and new smarter questions. The science of evolution is as expansive as nature itself.</p> <p>Evolution goes a long way toward answering the universal question that ran through my brain as a kid, and still does: &#x201c;Where did we come from?&#x201d; It also leads right into the companion question we all ask: &#x201c;Are we alone in the universe?&#x201d; Today, astronomers are finding planets rotating around distant stars, planets that might have the right conditions for supporting life. Our robots are prospecting on Mars looking for signs of water and life. We&#x2019;re planning a mission to study the ocean of Jupiter&#x2019;s moon Europa, where there is twice as much seawater as there is here on Earth. When we go seeking life elsewhere, the whole idea of what to look for, and where to look for it, will be guided by our understanding of evolution. Such a discovery would be profound. Proving that there is life on another world would surely change this one.</p> <p>The great questions of evolution bring out the best in us: our boundless curiosity, and our boundless ability to explore. After all, evolution made us who we are.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by William S.

The absurd, real, comical, and tragic are combined into a fantastic read. The hero&#x2014;or antihero&#x2014;is Ximen Nao, a landowner known for his kindness to his peasants. His tale is a heart-wrenching and unique journey and completely riveting tale that shares the author&#x2019;s love of a homeland caught by ills political, traditional, and inevitable.</p><p><strong></strong>Mo Yan, winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize for Literature, was born in 1955 in North Gaomi Township in Shandong Province, an impoverished rural area that is the setting for much of his fiction. Despite the audacity of his writing, he has won virtually every national literary prize, including China&#x2019;s Annual Writer&#x2019;s Prize, its most prestigious award. He is the author of<em> The Garlic Ballads</em>, <em>The Republic of Wine</em>; <em>Shifu, You&#x2019;ll Do Anything for a Laugh</em>; <em>Big Breasts and Wide Hips</em>, and <em>Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out</em>, all published by Arcade, as well as <em>Red Sorghum </em>and <em>Pow!</em>. Mo Yan and his family live in Beijing.<br><br><strong></strong><strong>Howard Goldblatt</strong> taught modern Chinese literature and culture for more than a quarter of a century. He is the foremost translator of modern and contemporary Chinese literature in the West and a former Guggenheim Fellow.<p> Reviewed by Steven Moore</p><p></p><p>To encompass the ideological insanity of Mao Zedong's policies and the unimaginable horrors he inflicted on the Chinese people requires a boldly unconventional style. That need has been filled by this wild man of Chinese fiction: Mo Yan -- a pseudonymic phrase meaning "Don't speak." Over the last 20 years, Mo Yan has been writing brutally vibrant stories about rural life in China that flout official Party ideology and celebrate individualism over conformity. (How he has escaped imprisonment -- or worse -- I don't know.) He also flouts literary conformity, spiking his earthy realism with fantasy, hallucination and metafiction. </p><p>His previous novel, the voluptuously titled Big Breasts &amp; Wide Hips, revealed the horrors of Chinese life during the first half of the 20th century; his new one, the exuberantly imaginative Life And Death Are Wearing Me Out, covers the second, even worse half. The story, which revives the Buddhist notion of reincarnation, begins on Jan. 1, 1950, in hell. Lord Yama, king of the underworld, is examining a benevolent landowner named Ximen Nao, who was brutally executed two years earlier (like thousands of landowners) so that his land could be redistributed to peasants. Frustrated that Ximen will not admit any guilt, Yama punishes him by sending him back to his village in the form of a donkey.</p><p></p><p>Ximen remains in that form for the next 10 years, witnessing the Land Reform Movement and the disastrous Great Leap Forward that killed tens of millions of people (and an unrecorded number of Chinese animals -- the novel reminds us this Earth belongs to them, too). The donkey is angry at first when he learns his trusted farmhand Lan Lian has married Ximen's concubine, but he's mollified as Lan carries on as a fiercely independent farmer, the last holdout in collectivized China. The donkey is killed during the great famine, accompanied by appropriate animal imagery: "Then the famine came," Mo Yan writes, "turning the people into wild animals, cruel and unfeeling. After eating all the bark from trees and the edible grass, a gang of them charged into the Ximen estate compound like a pack of starving wolves." Ximen is reincarnated next as an ox, then a pig, a dog, a monkey and finally -- on New Year's Eve 2000 -- as a child. On his fifth birthday, the child and elderly Lan Lian get together and, taking turns, narrate the novel we've just read.</p><p></p><p>It's a grimly entertaining overview of recent Chinese history. As a "wise German shepherd" summarizes it, "People in the 1950s were innocent, in the 1960s they were fanatics, in the 1970s they were afraid of their own shadows, in the 1980s they carefully weighed people's words and actions, and in the 1990s they were simply evil." But brave individuals emerge as the true heroes; aside from the animal reincarnations of Ximen Nao, these include Lan Lian for refusing to give in to communal pressure, and his son Lan Jiefang, who defies convention by abandoning his legal wife (from an arranged marriage) for a woman he loves, ruining himself in the process. The most colorful individual is the novelist himself, who pops in and out of the story, usually to the annoyance of the other characters.</p><p>But I don't want to leave the impression that this is a gimmicky book that makes light of recent Chinese history. Born in 1955, Mo Yan endured the worst of it -- he, too, was so poor that he ate tree bark -- and there are descriptions that will shock readers into realizing this is no literary game. Indeed, reality keeps outrunning the author's satire. Near the end of the novel, a born-again capitalist devises a Cultural Revolution theme park, as tasteless as a Nazi theme park in Poland. And yet there are now Cultural Revolution-themed caf�s in China, favored by urban hipsters with an almost American ignorance of history. </p><p>Mo Yan offers insights into communist ideology and predatory capitalism that we ignore at our peril. This "lumbering animal of a story," as he calls it, combines the appeal of a family saga set against tumultuous events with the technical bravura of innovative fiction.

She lives with her family in Martin&#39;s Creek, Pennsylvania.An immigrant boy's tattered woolen coat helps secure his entrance to America in this thoughtful picture book. Grisha, whose parents have died, now lives with his cousin Rachel's boisterous family in a Russian shtetl. Grisha misses his parents terribly, though he finds comfort in playing storytelling games with Rachel ("they were the best of friends") and in wearing the now-ragged coat sewn by his mother. But after cossacks terrorize the Jews of the shtetl, Rachel's family flees to America. At Ellis Island an inspector notes a scratch on Grisha's eye and marks his coat, indicating that he is rejected. Luckily, quick-thinking Rachel turns Grisha's coat inside out, allowing him to pass with the rest of the family. Woodruff (The Orphan of Ellis Island) steeps her tale in history, and at times the abundance of scene-setting detail bogs down the story's pacing.

George, Stanford University, and Andrew Bennett, Georgetown University)</p><h2>Principles of Statistics (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>There are many textbooks which describe current methods of statistical analysis, while neglecting related theory. There are equally many advanced textbooks which delve into the far reaches of statistical theory, while bypassing practical applications. But between these two approaches is an unfilled gap, in which theory and practice merge at an intermediate level. Professor M. G. Bulmer's <i>Principles of Statistics,</i> originally published in 1965, was created to fill that need. The new, corrected Dover edition of <i>Principles of Statistics</i> makes this invaluable mid-level text available once again for the classroom or for self-study. <i>Principles of Statistics </i>was created primarily for the student of natural sciences, the social scientist, the undergraduate mathematics student, or anyone familiar with the basics of mathematical language. It assumes no previous knowledge of statistics or probability; nor is extensive mathematical knowledge necessary beyond a familiarity with the fundamentals of differential and integral calculus. (The calculus is used primarily for ease of notation; skill in the techniques of integration is not necessary in order to understand the text.)<br>Professor Bulmer devotes the first chapters to a concise, admirably clear description of basic terminology and fundamental statistical theory: abstract concepts of probability and their applications in dice games, Mendelian heredity, etc.; definitions and examples of discrete and continuous random variables; multivariate distributions and the descriptive tools used to delineate them; expected values; etc. <br>The book then moves quickly to more advanced levels, as Professor Bulmer describes important distributions (binomial, Poisson, exponential, normal, etc.), tests of significance, statistical inference, point estimation, regression, and correlation. Dozens of exercises and problems appear at the end of various chapters, with answers provided at the back of the book. Also included are a number of statistical tables and selected references.</p><p></p><h2>Praying with My Fingers: An Easy Way to Talk with God</h2><p><b>Inspired by Pope Francis</b><br><br> Thank you God for loving me...thank you that you hear me when I pray.

Surely it is the most misunderstood book in the Bible. And some faulty interpretations of Revelation are so entrenched in the consciousness of Christians that they are regarded as "gospel truth" and provide riveting plot lines for end-time fiction. But behind the ancient multimedia show that is Revelation lies a message both simple and profound. It is told in a language and grammar of faith that was clearly understood by its first Christian audience. Much as a music video would scarcely have been understood by first-century citizens, though it is immediately understood by youthful audiences today, so we are puzzled by and misread Revelation. Paul Spilsbury has studied Revelation in the company of its best interpreters, those who have taken the time to enter the minds of the first-century Christians for whom it was originally written. And what has he found? Within the central images of a throne, a lamb and a dragon lies the answer-- <ul><li>the gospel clearly proclaimed</li><li>the glory of God awesomely illumined</li><li>the work of Christ memorably embodied</li><li>the nature of evil hauntingly disclosed</li></ul> Here is a guide that will help us hear Revelation speak, once again inspiring grateful worship and calling us to costly discipleship.</p><p>Paul Spilsbury (PhD, Cambridge University) is academic dean and professor of New Testament at Regent College in Vancouver.

Fort Mose was not only the first free black settlement, but it was also the most southern link of the Underground Railroad as a haven of refuge, just as cities in Canada were the northern most link.&nbsp;<br><br>Beginning with the story of Francisco Menendez, the Captain of the Black Militia of St. Augustine, FORT MOSE follows the history of slavery from West Africa to America, recounts what daily life was like, and describes the founding of the Spanish colony&#x2019;s Fort Mose. Established in 1738, Fort Mose gave sanctuary to escaped Africans, challenging slavery in the English colonies. Approximately one hundred Africans lived together, creating a frontier community that drew on a range of African backgrounds, blending them with those of Spanish, Native American, and English people and cultural traditions.&nbsp;<br><br>The book includes more than forty archival images, an afterword about uncovering Fort Mose (which is now part of the National Parks), a glossary, an author&#x2019;s note, a bibliography, and an index.<br><br><p></p>Praise for <i>Fort Mose</i><br><b>Starred Review:</b><br>"Turner&#x2019;s graceful account clearly distinguishes between fact and supposition.

She lives in Wheaton, Illinois.<p></p><p></p>Gr 4-8&#x2013;In the 18th century, some Africans escaped slavery in England's southern colonies to find freedom in the Spanish colony of Florida. As a leader of St. Augustine's community, African-born Francisco Menendez helped establish Fort Mose, the first free black community on North American soil. Turner does an excellent job of explaining how the residents of Fort Mose probably blended African, English, and Spanish traditions to create a unique&#x2013;and uniquely American&#x2013;culture. Her careful choice of words and images demonstrates that drawing such conclusions about early American history can be difficult when written records are hard to find and sketchy at best. For instance, a 16th-century sketch of a Florida Timucua Indian village is juxtaposed with a 20th-century photo of a West African village. Captions explain that Menendez &#x201c;would have been familiar&#x201d; with the design of these African buildings. The text also elaborates on how Fort Mose buildings probably combined Native American and African architectural elements. An afterword explains that Fort Mose no longer stands, but its site is included in Florida's state-park system. Turner describes her research in an author's note. This is a useful addition to libraries with strong African-American history collections, and for teachers and librarians looking for unique stories about colonial America.<i>Mary Landrum, Lexington Public Library, KY</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

At first he thought of reaching for his shotgun, but then he remembered that Lucille had made him sell it years ago on account of an incident involving a traveling preacher and an argument having to do with hunting dogs.<br><br>"Can I help you?" Harold said, squinting in the sunlight- light which only made the dark-skinned man in the suit look darker.<br><br>"Mr. Hargrave?" the man said. "I suppose," Harold replied.<br><br>"Who is it, Harold?" Lucille called. She was in the living room being vexed by the television. The news announcer was talking about Edmund Blithe, the first of the Returned, and how his life had changed now that he was alive again.<br><br>"Better the second time around?" the announcer on the television asked, speaking directly into the camera, laying the burden of answering squarely on the shoulders of his viewers.<br><br>The wind rustled through the oak tree in the yard near the house, but the sun was low enough that it drove horizontally beneath the branches and into Harold's eyes. He held a hand over his eyes like a visor, but still, the dark-skinned man and the boy were little more than silhouettes plastered against a green-and-blue backdrop of pine trees beyond the open yard and cloudless sky out past the trees. The man was thin, but square-framed in his manicured suit. The boy was small for what Harold estimated to be about the age of eight or nine.<br><br>Harold blinked. His eyes adjusted more.<br><br>"Who is it, Harold?" Lucille called a second time, after realizing that no reply had come to her first inquiry.<br><br>Harold only stood in the doorway, blinking like a hazard light, looking down at the boy, who consumed more and more of his attention. Synapses kicked on in the recesses of his brain. They crackled to life and told him who the boy was standing next to the dark-skinned stranger. But Harold was sure his brain was wrong. He made his mind to do the math again, but it still came up with the same answer.<br><br>In the living room the television camera cut away to a cluster of waving fists and yelling mouths, people holding signs and shouting, then soldiers with guns standing statuesque as only men laden with authority and ammunition can. In the center was the small semidetached house of Edmund Blithe, the curtains drawn. That he was somewhere inside was all that was known.<br><br>Lucille shook her head. "Can you imagine it?" she said. Then: "Who is it at the door, Harold?"<br><br>Harold stood in the doorway taking in the sight of the boy: short, pale, freckled, with a shaggy mop of brown hair. He wore an old-style T-shirt, a pair of jeans and a great look of relief in his eyes-eyes that were not still and frozen, but trembling with life and rimmed with tears.<br><br>"What has four legs and goes 'Boooo'?" the boy asked in a shaky voice.<br><br>Harold cleared his throat-not certain just then of even that. "I don't know," he said. "A cow with a cold!"<br><br>Then the child had the old man by the waist, sobbing, "Daddy! Daddy!" before Harold could confirm or deny. Harold fell against the door frame-very nearly bowled over- and patted the child's head out of some long-dormant paternal instinct. "Shush," he whispered. "Shush."<br><br>"Harold?" Lucille called, finally looking away from the television, certain that some terror had darkened her door. "Harold, what's going on? Who is it?"<br><br>Harold licked his lips. "It's...it's..."<br><br>He wanted to say "Joseph."<br><br>"It's Jacob," he said, finally.<br><br>Thankfully for Lucille, the couch was there to catch her when she fainted.<br><br>Jacob William Hargrave died on August 15, 1966. On his eighth birthday, in fact. In the years that followed, townsfolk would talk about his death in the late hours of the night when they could not sleep. They would roll over to wake their spouses and begin whispered conversations about the uncertainty of the world and how blessings needed to be counted. Sometimes they would rise together from the bed to stand in the doorway of their children's bedroom to watch them sleep and to ponder silently on the nature of a God that would take a child so soon from this world. They were Southerners in a small town, after all: How could such a tragedy not lead them to God?<br><br>After Jacob's death, his mother, Lucille, would say that she'd known something terrible was going to happen that day on account of what had happened just the night before.<br><br>That night Lucille dreamed of her teeth falling out. Something her mother had told her long ago was an omen of death.<br><br>All throughout Jacob's birthday party Lucille had made a point to keep an eye on not only her son and the other children, but on all the other guests, as well. She flitted about like a nervous sparrow, asking how everyone was doing and if they'd had enough to eat and commenting on how much they'd slimmed down since last time she'd seen them or on how tall their children had gotten and, now and again, how beautiful the weather was. The sun was everywhere and everything was green that day.<br><br>Her unease made her a wonderful hostess. No child went unfed. No guest found themselves lacking conversation. She'd even managed to talk Mary Green into singing for them later in the evening. The woman had a voice silkier than sugar, and Jacob, if he was old enough to have a crush on someone, had a thing for her, something that Mary's husband, Fred, often ribbed the boy about. It was a good day, that day. A good day, until Jacob disappeared.<br><br>He slipped away unnoticed the way only children and other small mysteries can. It was sometime between three and three-thirty-as Harold and Lucille would later tell the police- when, for reasons only the boy and the earth itself knew, Jacob made his way over the south side of the yard, down past the pines, through the forest and on down to the river, where, without permission or apology, he drowned.<br><br>Just days before the man from the Bureau showed up at their door Harold and Lucille had been discussing what they might do ifJacob "turned up Returned."<br><br>"They're not people," Lucille said, wringing her hands. They were on the porch. All important happenings occurred on the porch.<br><br>"We couldn't just turn him away," Harold told his wife. He stamped his foot. The argument had turned very loud very quickly.<br><br>"They're just not people," she repeated.<br><br>"Well, if they're not people, then what are they? Vegetable? Mineral?" Harold's lips itched for a cigarette. Smoking always helped him get the upper hand in an argument with his wife which, he suspected, was the real reason she made such a fuss about the habit.<br><br>"Don't be flippant with me, Harold Nathaniel Hargrave. This is serious."<br><br>"Flippant?"<br><br>"Yes, flippant! You're always flippant! Always prone to flippancy!"<br><br>"I swear. Yesterday it was, what, 'loquacious'? So today it's 'flippant,' huh?"<br><br>"Don't mock me for trying to better myself. My mind is still as sharp as it always was, maybe even sharper. And don't you go trying to get off subject."<br><br>"Flippant." Harold smacked the word, hammering the final <em>t</em> at the end so hard a glistening bead of spittle cleared the porch railing. "Hmph."<br><br>Lucille let it pass. "I don't know what they are," she continued. She stood. Then sat again. "All I know is they're not like you and me. They're...they're..." She paused. She prepared the word in her mouth, putting it together carefully, brick by brick. "They're devils," she finally said. Then she recoiled, as if the word might turn and bite her. "They've just come here to kill us. Or tempt us! These are the end days. 'When the dead shall walk the earth.' It's in the Bible!"<br><br>Harold snorted, still hung up on "flippant." His hand went to his pocket. "Devils?" he said, his mind finding its train of thought as his hand found his cigarette lighter. "Devils are superstitions. Products of small minds and even smaller imaginations. There's one word that should be banned from the dictionary- <em>devils.</em> Ha! Now there's a flippant word. It's got nothing to do with the way things really are, nothing to do with these 'Returned' folks-and make no mistake about it, Lucille Abigail Daniels Hargrave, they are people. They can walk over and kiss you. I ain't never met a devil that could do that...although, before we were married, there was this one blonde girl over in Tulsa one Saturday night. Yeah, now she might have been the devil, or a devil at least."<br><br>"Hush up!" Lucille barked, so loudly she seemed to surprise herself. "I won't sit here and listen to you talk that way."<br><br>"Talk what way?"<br><br>"It wouldn't be our boy," she said, her words slowing as the seriousness of things came drifting back to her, like the memory of a lost son, perhaps. "Jacob's gone on to God," she said. Her hands had become thin, white fists in her lap.<br><br>A silence came.<br><br>Then it passed.<br><br>"Where is it?" Harold asked.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"In the Bible, where is it?"<br><br>"Where's what?"<br><br>"Where does it say 'the dead will walk the earth'?"<br><br>"Revelations!" Lucille opened her arms as she said the word, as if the question could not be any more addle-brained, as if she'd been asked about the flight patterns of pine trees. "It's right there in Revelations! 'The dead shall walk the earth'!" She was glad to see that her hands were still fists. She waved them at no one, the way people in movies sometimes did.<br><br>Harold laughed. "What part of Revelations? What chapter? What verse?"<br><br>"You hush up," she said. "That it's in there is all that matters. Now hush!"<br><br>"Yes, ma'am," Harold said. "Wouldn't want to be flippant."<br><br>But when the devil actually showed up at the front door- their own particular devil-small and wondrous as he had been all those years ago, his brown eyes slick with tears, joy and the sudden relief of a child who has been too long away from his parents, too long of a time spent in the company of strangers...well...Lucille, after she recovered from her fainting episode, melted like candle wax right there in front of the clean-cut, well-suited man from the Bureau. For his part, the Bureau man took it well enough. He smiled a practiced smile, no doubt having witnessed this exact scene more than a few times in recent weeks.<br><br>"There are support groups," the Bureau man said. "Support groups for the Returned. And support groups for the families of the Returned." He smiled.<br><br>"He was found," the man continued-he'd given them his name but both Harold and Lucille were already terrible at remembering people's names and having been reunited with their dead son didn't do much to help now, so they thought of him simply as the Man from the Bureau "-in a small fishing village outside Beijing, China. He was kneeling at the edge of a river, trying to catch fish or some such from what I've been told. The local people, none of whom spoke English well enough for him to understand, asked him his name in Mandarin, how he'd gotten there, where he was from, all those questions you ask when coming upon a lost child.<br><br>"When it was clear that language was something of a barrier, a group of women were able to calm him. He'd started crying-and why wouldn't he?" The man smiled again. "After all, he wasn't in Kansas anymore. But they settled him down.<br><br>Then they found an English-speaking official and, well..."

His closest companion is a Chaos-ridden wolf, Havoc. His father suspects him of being secretly evil. And, of course, most kids aren&#x2019;t heading back to the magical world of the Magisterium in the fall.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s not easy for Call . . . and it gets even harder after he checks out his basement and discovers that his dad might be trying to destroy both him and Havoc.<br> &nbsp;<br> Call escapes to the Magisterium -- but things only intensify there. The Alkahest -- a copper gauntlet capable of separating certain magicians from their magic -- has been stolen. And in their search to discover the culprit, Call and his friends Aaron and Tamara awaken the attention of some very dangerous foes -- and get closer to an even more dangerous truth.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the mysteries of the Magisterium deepen and widen, bestselling authors Holly Black and Cassandra Clare take readers on an extraordinary journey through one boy&#x2019;s conflict -- and a whole world&#x2019;s fate.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Holly Black is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of The Spiderwick Chronicles (with Tony DiTerlizzi) and the Newbery Honor-winning novel <i>Doll Bones</i>. Her other books include The Good Neighbors graphic novels, and the novels <i>The Darkest Part of the Forest</i>, <i>Tithe</i>, <i>Valiant</i>, and <i>Ironside</i>. She currently lives in the realm of Western Massachusetts.<br><br>Cassandra Clare is the author of <i>City of Bones</i>, the first book in The Mortal Instruments trilogy and a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller. Her latest series, The Infernal Devices, has spawned three #1 bestsellers. Born overseas, Cassandra spent her early years traveling around the world with her family and several trunks of books. She lives in Massachusetts.Gr 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;In their follow-up to The Iron Trial (Scholastic, 2014), Black and Clare again return to the magical, alchemical world of the Magisterium, a school that neatly plays with the tropes of the magic school genre. At the conclusion of the last book, readers learned that the ostensible hero, Callum, was in fact the Enemy of Death&#x2014;the villain who terrifies everyone in his magical world. When he discovers a plot seemingly orchestrated by his own father against the Magisterium, Call and his friends run away from school to try and save the magical world they love. Much of the action in this second installment takes place outside the claustrophobic caverns of the Magisterium, expanding the world Call and friends Tamara and Adam inhabit with mixed results. Credulity is stretched whenever any member of the group enters our mundane world&#x2014;would giant wolves with glowing eyes and four 13-year-olds hot-wiring a car really go unnoticed by average people?&#x2014;but other big set pieces, especially an epic battle against an ancient monster, thrill. There's plenty of action, adventure, and pathos here to even out the rough patches.

Based on fifteen years of research, <i>The Emperor's New Drugs</i> makes an overwhelming case that what the medical community considered a cornerstone of psychiatric treatment is little more than a faulty consensus.

The week before her graduation, in that sheltered wonderland, three lives were taken, all victims of suicide. Only Jane was left to carry the burden of a mystery that has stayed hidden in the depths of Heart Lake for more than two decades. Now Jane has returned to the school as a Latin teacher, recently separated and hoping to make a fresh start with her young daughter. But ominous messages from the past dredge up forgotten memories. And young, troubled girls are beginning to die again&#x2013;as piece by piece the shattering truth slowly floats to the surface. . . .</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, February 2002:</b> It has been 20 years since Jane Hudson graduated from Heart Lake School in the Adirondacks. After marrying, having a child, and separating from her husband, she returns to her old, all-girls school to teach Latin. <p> Heart Lake, like many schools, has its legends, the most persistent being that the lake claims the lives of students. All three daughters of the founder of the school were drowned in it, and while the bodies were never found, it is said that three rocks rose out of the water to lure young girls to their doom. Jane is more than aware of this legend. When she was at school, two of her contemporaries drowned in the lake, and Jane has always felt that it was looking for a third victim--herself. </p><p> While she does not discuss this with her students, she is aware that they know of the legend. Her three most promising students room together, are close to each other, and look on Jane as their special teacher, a situation that mirrors Jane's experience as a student. But soon Jane is into a routine, has renewed her acquaintance with teachers, now colleagues, who are still at Heart Lake, and has met other teachers new to her.</p><p> But when a portion of her journal is left for her to see, Jane is puzzled. She has not seen the journal since she left school. Then one of her students almost drowns in what appears to be a suicide attempt, and Jane realizes that the nightmare she lived through at school may be recurring. </p><p> Jane tries to piece together what really happened in her school days and what is happening now. As a young girl, Jane was poor and managed to get to Heart Lake because she won a scholarship. She was befriended by the charismatic Lucy and her brother Matt, and it is with Lucy that she roomed, together with Deirdre. The three girls bonded with their Latin teacher, Helen Chambers. As we learn more about Jane's school days and contrast it with what is happening 20 years later, it becomes obvious that history is repeating itself--or someone is trying to make it seem that way.</p><p> While it takes a while for the pieces to fall into place, this compelling first novel is as much about the charged atmosphere of adolescents and their new and sometimes dangerous emotions as it is about what exactly is happening at Heart Lake School and why.

Many people in the tent were trying to be heard, but the clear voice of a young minstrel floated above it all, singing a song of heroism:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Sing ye loud his royal name</p><p>Seoman the Glorious!</p><p>Spread it far, his royal fame</p><p>Seoman the Glorious!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The king did not look glorious. He looked tired. Tiamak could see it in the lines of Simon&#x2019;s face, the way his shoulders hunched as if he awaited a blow. But that blow had already fallen. Today was only the grim anniversary.</p><p>Limping more than usual because of the cold day, little Tiamak made his way among all the larger men. These courtiers and important officials were gathered around the king, who sat on one of two high-backed wooden chairs at the center of the tent, both draped in the royal colors. A banner with the twin drakes, the red and the white, hung above them. The other chair was empty.</p><p>As a makeshift throne room in the middle of a Hernystir field, Tiamak thought, it was more than adequate, but it was also clearly the one place King Seoman did not want to be. Not today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;With hero&#x2019;s sword in his right hand</p><p>And nought but courage in his heart</p><p>Did Seoman make his gallant stand</p><p>Though cowards fled apart</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;When the hellspawned Norns did bring</p><p>Foul war upon the innocent</p><p>And giants beat upon the gates</p><p>And Norn sails filled the Gleniwent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; said the king loudly to one of the courtiers. &#x201c;In truth, my good man, I haven&#x2019;t understood a thing you&#x2019;ve said, what with all this shouting and caterwauling. Why should they have to lime the bridges? Do they think we are birds that need catching?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Line the bridges, sire.&#x201d;</p><p>The king scowled. &#x201c;I know, Sir Murtach. It was meant as a jest. But it still doesn&#x2019;t make any sense.&#x201d;</p><p>The courtier&#x2019;s determined smile faltered. &#x201c;It is the tradition for the people to line up along the bridges as well as the roads, but King Hugh is concerned that the bridges might not stand under the weight of so many.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And so we must give up our wagons and come on foot? All of us?&#x201d;</p><p>Sir Murtach flinched. &#x201c;It is what King Hugh requests, Your Majesty.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;When armies of the Stormlord came</p><p>Unto the very Swertclif plain</p><p>Who stood on Hayholt&#x2019;s battlements</p><p>And bade them all turn back again?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Sing ye loud his royal name</p><p>Seoman the Glorious!</p><p>Spread it far, his royal fame</p><p>Seoman the Glorious!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>King Simon&#x2019;s head had tipped to one side. It was not the side from which he was being urgently addressed by another messenger, who had finally worked his way to a place beside the makeshift throne. Something had distracted Simon. Tiamak thought that seeing the king&#x2019;s temper fray was like watching a swamp flatboat beginning to draw water. It was plain that if someone didn&#x2019;t do something soon, the whole craft would sink.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;He slew the dragon fierce and cold</p><p>And banished winter by his hand</p><p>He tamed the Sithi proud and old</p><p>And saved the blighted, threatened land&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Murtach was still talking in one royal ear, and the other messenger had started his speech for the third time when Simon suddenly stood. The courtiers fell back swiftly, like hunting hounds when the bear turns at bay. The king&#x2019;s beard was still partly red, but he had enough gray in it now, as well as the broad white stripe where he had once been splashed by dragon&#x2019;s blood, that when his anger was up he looked a bit like an Aedonite prophet from the old days.</p><p>&#x201c;That! That!&#x201d; Simon shouted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s bad enough that I cannot hear myself think, that every man in camp wants me to do something or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or not do something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but must I listen to such terrible lies and exaggerations as well?&#x201d; He turned and pointed his finger at the miscreant. &#x201c;Well? Must I?&#x201d;</p><p>At the far end of the king&#x2019;s finger, the young minstrel stared back with the round eyes of a quiet, nighttime grazer caught in the sudden glare of a torch. He swallowed. It seemed to take a long time. &#x201c;Beg pardon, Majesty?&#x201d; he squeaked.</p><p>&#x201c;That song! That preposterous song! &#x2018;He slew the dragon fierce and cold&#x2019;&#x2014;a palpable lie!&#x201d; The king strode forward until he towered over the thin, dark-haired singer, who seemed to be melting and shrinking like a snowflake caught in a warm hand. &#x201c;By the Bloody Tree, I never killed that dragon, I just wounded it a bit. I was terrified. And I didn&#x2019;t tame the Sithi either, for the love of our lord Usires!&#x201d;</p><p>The minstrel looked at up at him, mouth working but without sound.</p><p>&#x201c;And the rest of the song is even more mad. Banished the winter? You might as well say I make the sun rise every day!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;B-But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it is only a song, Majesty,&#x201d; the minstrel finally said. &#x201c;It is a well-known and well-loved one&#x2014;all the people sing it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pfah.&#x201d; But Simon was no longer shouting. His anger was like a swift storm&#x2014;the thunder had boomed, now all that was left was cold rain. &#x201c;Then go sing it to all the people. Or better yet, when we return to the Hayholt, ask old Sangfugol what really happened. Ask him what it was truly like when the Storm King&#x2019;s darkness came down on us and we all pissed ourselves in fear.&#x201d;</p><p>A moment of confused bravery showed itself on the young man&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;But it was Sangfugol who made that song, Your Majesty. And he was the one who taught it to me.&#x201d;</p><p>Simon growled. &#x201c;So, then all bards are liars. Go on, boy. Get away from me.&#x201d;</p><p>The minstrel looked quite forlorn as he pushed his way toward the door of the pavilion. Tiamak caught at his sleeve as he went by. &#x201c;Wait outside,&#x201d; he told the singer. &#x201c;Wait for me.&#x201d;</p><p>The young man was so full of anguish he had not truly heard. &#x201c;I beg pardon?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just wait outside for a few moments. I will come for you.&#x201d;</p><p>The youth looked at the little Wrannaman oddly, but everyone in the court knew Tiamak and how close he was to the king and queen. The harper blinked his eyes, doing his best to compose himself. &#x201c;If you say so, my lord.&#x201d;</p><p>Simon was already driving the rest of the courtiers from the pavilion. &#x201c;Enough! Leave me be now, all of you. I cannot do everything, and certainly not in one day! Give me peace!&#x201d;</p><p>Tiamak waited until the wave of humanity had swept past him and out of the tent, then he waited a bit longer until the king finished pacing and dropped back onto his chair. Simon looked up at his councilor and his face sagged with unhappiness and useless anger. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look at me that way, Tiamak.&#x201d;</p><p>The king seldom lost his temper with those who served him, and was much loved for it. Back home in Erkynland many called him &#x201c;the Commoner King&#x201d; or even &#x201c;the Scullion King&#x201d; because of his youthful days as a Hayholt dogsbody. Generally Simon remembered very well indeed what it felt like to be ignored or blamed by those with power. But sometimes, especially when he was in the grip of such heartache as he was today, he fell into foul moods.</p><p>Tiamak, of course, knew that the moods seldom lasted long and were followed quickly by regret. &#x201c;I am not looking at you in any particular way, Majesty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mock me. You are. It&#x2019;s that sad, wise expression you put on when you&#x2019;re thinking about what a dunderhead one of your monarchs is. And that monarch is nearly always me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You need rest, Majesty.&#x201d; It was a privilege to speak as old friends, one that Tiamak would never have presumed on with others in the room. &#x201c;You are weary and your temper is short.&#x201d;</p><p>The king opened his mouth, then shook his head. &#x201c;This is a bad day,&#x201d; he said at last. &#x201c;A very bad day. Where is Miriamele?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The queen declined any audiences today. She is out walking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am glad for her. I hope she is being left alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As much as she wishes to be. Her ladies are with her. She likes company more than you do on days like this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Days like this, I would like to be on the top of a mountain in the Trollfells with Binabik and his folk, with nothing but snow to look at and nothing but wind to hear.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We have plenty of wind for you here in this meadow,&#x201d; Tiamak said. &#x201c;But not too much snow, considering that there is still almost a fortnight of winter left.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I know what day it is, what month,&#x201d; Simon said. &#x201c;I need no reminding.&#x201d;</p><p>Tiamak cleared his throat. &#x201c;Of course not. But will you take my advice? Rest yourself for a while. Let your unhappiness cool.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hearing that nonsense, over and over&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Simon the hero, all of that. I did not seem such a hero when my son&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please, Majesty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I should not have taken it out on the harper.&#x201d; Again, the storm had blown over quickly, and now Simon was shaking his head. &#x201c;He has given me many a sweet hour of song before. It is not his fault that lies become history so quickly. Perhaps I should tell him that I was unfair, and I am sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>Tiamak hid his smile. A king who apologized! No wonder he was tied to his two monarchs with bonds stronger than iron. &#x201c;I will confess, it was not like you, Majesty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, find him for me, would you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In truth, I think he is just outside the tent, Majesty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, for the love of St. Tunath and St. Rhiap, Tiamak, would you please stop calling me &#x2018;Majesty&#x2019; when we&#x2019;re alone? You said he was nearby?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go see, Simon.&#x201d;</p><p>The minstrel was indeed near, cowering from the brisk Marris winds in a fold of tent wall beside the doorway. He followed Tiamak back into the pavilion like a man expecting a death sentence.</p><p>&#x201c;There you are,&#x201d; the king said. &#x201c;Come. Your name is Rinan, yes?&#x201d;</p><p>The eyes, already wide, grew wider still. &#x201c;Yes, Majesty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was harsh to you, Rinan. Today&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am not a happy man today.&#x201d;</p><p>Tiamak thought that the harper, like everyone else in the royal court, knew only too well what day it was, but was wise enough to stay quiet while the king struggled to find words.</p><p>&#x201c;In any case, I am sorry for it,&#x201d; the king said. &#x201c;Come back to me tomorrow, and I will be in a better humor for songs. But have that old scoundrel Sangfugol teach you a few lays that at least approach the truth, if not actually wrestle with it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sire.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go on then. You have a fine voice. Remember that music is a noble charge, even a dangerous charge, because it can pierce a man&#x2019;s heart when a spear or arrow cannot.&#x201d;</p><p>As the young man hurried out of the pavilion, Simon looked up at his old friend. &#x201c;I suppose now I must bring back all the others and make amends to them as well?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see no reason why you should,&#x201d; Tiamak told him. &#x201c;You have already given them all the hours since you broke your fast. I think it might be good for you to eat and rest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I have to reply to King Hugh and his damned &#x2018;suggestions,&#x2019; as he calls them.&#x201d; Simon tugged at his beard. &#x201c;What is he about, Tiamak? You would think with all these nonsensical conditions, he would rather not have us come to Hernysadharc at all. Does he resent having to feed and house even this fairly small royal progress?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m sure that&#x2019;s not so. The Hernystiri are always finicky with their rituals.&#x201d; But secretly Tiamak did not like it either. It was one thing to insist on proper arrangements, another thing to keep the High King and High Queen waiting in a field for two days over issues of ceremony that should have been settled weeks ago. After all, the king of Hernystir would not have a throne at all were it not for the High Ward that Simon and Miriamele represented. Hernystir only had a king because Miri&#x2019;s grandfather, King John, had permitted it under his own overarching rule. Still, Tiamak thought, Hugh was a comparatively young king: perhaps this rudeness was nothing more than a new monarch&#x2019;s inexperience. &#x201c;I am certain Sir Murtach, Count Eolair, and I will have everything set to rights soon,&#x201d; he said aloud.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I hope you&#x2019;re right, Tiamak. Tell them we agree to everything and to send us the be-damned invitation tomorrow morning. It&#x2019;s a sad errand that brings us this way in the first place, and today is a sad anniversary. It seems pointless to dicker about such things&#x2014;how many banners, how high the thrones, the procession route&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He wagged his hand in disgust. &#x201c;If Hugh wishes to make himself look important, let him. He can act like a child if he wants, but Miri and I don&#x2019;t need to.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You may be doing the king of Hernystir a disservice,&#x201d; said Tiamak mildly, but in his heart of hearts he didn&#x2019;t think so. He truly didn&#x2019;t think so.</p></p><h2>Getting Started with English Language Learners: How Educators Can Meet the Challenge (Professional Development)</h2><p>In Getting Started with English Language Learners: How Educators Can Meet the Challenge, Judie Haynes provides a practical resource to help educators who are new to the field of English as a Second Language understand the needs of English language learners.

Merging business, finance, and law, this insightful examination of M&amp;A strategy is designed to help you understand M&amp;A negotiations and the ways in which the final outcome affects your financial future. A general overview of an acquisition agreement framework segues into a more detailed discussion of different deal structures, including stock sales, mergers, asset sales, and complex structures, giving you the information you need to know when each one applies best in practice. You'll gain insight into real-world negotiations and the delicate balancing act that occurs as each party attempts to maximize value and minimize risk, and learn the potential pitfalls that can occur. Negotiation statistics and samples from actual contracts back the war stories throughout, and reinforce the idea that there's no single perfect solution. </p><p>As a topic of study, M&amp;A is constantly evolving; in practice, it changes at the speed of light. Staying ahead of the market is the single most critical element of making the best deal, and the strategy that worked for one deal most likely won't work for the next. Instead of simply providing a list of strategies that have worked in the past, this book shows you <i>why</i> they worked, so you can tailor your strategy specifically to your next deal. </p><ul> <li>Learn how M&amp;A contract terms affect economic outcomes</li> <li>Examine the techniques and mechanics of today's acquisition agreements</li> <li>Develop a legal framework that supports your business strategy</li> <li>Follow the ups and downs that arise in real-world cases</li> </ul> <p>A successful M&amp;A transaction requires both attention to detail and a big picture view, combined with skill, intellect, and ingenuity. <i>Make the Deal</i> brings it all together to show you how to run the table and come away with a win.</p></p><p><p><b>Praise for MAKE THE DEAL</b> </p><p>"<i>Make the Deal</i> by Chris Harrison, a highly regarded M&amp;A practitioner and adjunct professor at the NYU School of Law, is a very useful text for both experienced M&amp;A lawyers and for young lawyers seeking useful guidance in preparing and negotiating a merger agreement.

Highlighting what it takes to negotiate a successful merger or acquisition through adroit analysis and hands-on experience, <i>Make the Deal</i> shows that juggling legal terms is no esoteric exercise, but defines the financial result of the deal. Mr. Harrison's insight into current techniques and market trends make his book an indispensable companion in today's ever-changing M&amp;A landscape. </p><p><i>Make the Deal</i> shows you how to run the table and come away with a win.</p><p>No deal is like another. And any one deal can take various legal shapes, but you do not have a deal until you have a structure. Depending on the legal terms used, what seems like a straightforward business proposition can have highly disparate economic outcomes. To navigate this process successfully, the lawyer has to think in business terms and the business person has to understand the function and potential of the different legal elements that make the deal. </p><p>In <i>Make the Deal</i>, Mergers and Acquisition pundit Christopher S. Harrison combines business, finance, and legal expertise to provide an essential and highly accessible overview of the complicated and often labyrinthous M&amp;A process. Showing how legal form conditions the economic outlook, he reveals what it takes to support a business strategy with a legal framework and what the economic ramifications of specific deal terms and their interrelations might be. </p><p>Intended as a tool for both business leaders and lawyers as well as students who aspire to such roles, <i>Make the Deal</i> not only offers a comprehensive and comprehensible compendium of deal terminology, but also provides a road map of how the various terms interact, how to negotiate one point with all the others in mind, and how to organize a successful deal process. Compelling war stories highlight what is at stake. Sample provisions give examples of clear, effective deal language. And easily readable graphics synthesize exhaustive deal study data to give the practitioner and the student a keen sense for the realities of the M&amp;A market.</p></p><h2>Enhancing RTI: How to Ensure Success with Effective Classroom Instruction and Intervention (Professional Development)</h2><p>In Enhancing RTI, the authors argue that students learn best when classroom instruction and supplemental intervention mirror each other in both content and purpose.

These improbable productions were meant to educate and motivate the sales force to sell cars, appliances, tractors, soda, and a thousand other products. Though most of these shows were lost to the universe, some were recorded and distributed to convention attendees via souvenir vinyl records. The little-known world of industrial shows is reconstructed through the record collection of author Steve Young, who has spent twenty years finding the extremely rare souvenir albums as well as tracking down and interviewing the writers and performers. Through the records themselves as well as behind-the-scenes stories, a new perspective on American history, culture, and business emerges. Eye-popping visuals, samples of confounding and hilarious lyrics, and witty commentary by Young and co-author Sport Murphy (who also contributes original artwork) bring the topic to vivid, astonishing life. A companion website will offer streaming audio of the songs which seem too crazy to be real&#x2014;but not only are they real, they're often a revelation.</p><p><b>Steve Young</b> is a writer for <i>The Late Show with David Letterman</i>.

Anyone interested in American history, music, or culture should buy this book by the fistful." <b>Dave Letterman</b><br><br>"The world of industrial musicals is magical, weird, and funny. Mssrs. Young and Murphy escort you into that world with panache and not nearly enough guilt. Like Steve, I amassed a collection of these records souvenirs of the days when corporations were rich enough to care about the morale of their employees and like him, I thought I was the only one.&#x2019; Now these idiots have spent serious time and energy producing a freaking book on the subject. Humor them.

Straight from high school, too young to vote or buy himself a drink, he enters a world of mud and heat, blood and body counts, ambushes and firefights. It is here that he embarks on the brutal downward path to wisdom that awaits every soldier.

She disposes of the hard-dying myth that the great Italian actress played simply on the inspiration of the moment. Miss Le Gallienne&#39;s thesis is that Duse&#39;s artistic triumphs resulted from her victories over herself, triumphs of character achieved through intellectual and spiritual struggle. In support of her title Miss Le Gallienne adduces evidence of Duse&#39;s long and earnest study of the writings of mystics and philosophers. This book is thoughtful, sensible, candid and literate.

Mexico's was the first massive social revolution of the twentieth century, visiting economic, cultural, and racial strife on a country already exploited by oppressive officials and crippled by poverty, but also offering hope to its people. The ruthless Villa and his army of ex-cowboys in the north and Zapata, recruiting his infantry from the sugar plantations of the south, successfully waged a devastating war on two fronts and brought down a string of autocrats in Mexico City. But the two men failed to make common cause and ultimately fell victim to intrigues more treacherous than their own. <br></p><p><b>Frank McLynn</b> is the author of numerous works of history and biography, including <i>Genghis Khan</i>, <i>Napoleon</i>, and <i>Wagons West</i>. A graduate of Oxford and the University of London, he lives in England.The Mexican Revolution began in 1910 and lasted for over a decade, a bloody and confusing saga of betrayal, corruption, misshapen politics and mislaid trusts that, in the end, accomplished little for lower- and lower-middle class Mexicans. Historian and biographer McLynn (Carl Gustav Jung; etc.) reconstructs the revolution through the biographies of its two most important figures, Francisco (Pancho) Villa, the bandit-turned-revolutionary, and Emiliano Zapata, whose declaration, "It's better to die on our feet than to live on our knees," later became La Pasionaria's Spanish Civil War slogan. Comprehensive almost to a fault, McLynn also devotes many pages to other key players: the revolution's first leader, Francisco Madero, who, having defeated President Porfirio D�az, stopped short of killing the president and members of the fallen government; and the ambitious Pascual Orozco, a controversial revolutionary figure believed by some (his pal Villa later among them) to have been on D�az's payroll. Having moved briskly and clearly through the disorganization and obfuscation of one of the bloodiest (and longest) revolutions in history, the author makes this informative, insightful study even more compelling with his witty and fluid prose. In his exhaustive research, McLynn plumbed "the ranks of the apocrypha," compared conservative histories to liberal ones and accounted for trends (economic, cultural, agricultural, industrial) concurrent with and pertinent to the revolution. McLynn grasps so completely and communicates so deftly the nuances of government corruption, the U.S. stance toward a long succession of Mexican autocrats, infighting between Zapatistas and Villistas, that this book feels less like a history than a great story, as exciting as a Saturday serial Western.

In this part of town, people generally couldn&#x2019;t afford a lot of fuel; they lit their fires only when they returned from work, and banked them as soon as they were ready to get under the covers in bed.</p><p>The street was relatively narrow, and the houses and shops were crowded closely together and on the dilapidated side. Most of them hadn&#x2019;t been repainted in decades, and although they were in repair, you couldn&#x2019;t exactly call it <i>good</i> repair; priority here was on keeping the building standing and the roof sound. After that, the landlords often left it up to the tenants to patch holes and repair shutters. The two- and three-story buildings crowded close together, sometimes leaning a little toward each other like whispering gossips. About half of them had a shop of some sort on the first floor, though many people, especially women, worked out of their homes&#x2014;doing things like sewing, mending, and laundry. The wind that whipped down the street at him carried some of the scents of that business: cookshop aromas (redolent with the two staples of the poor, cabbage and onions), wet laundry, and beer. It was too late in the day for bread-baking, at least around here. The couple of bakers on this street baked their wares in the very early morning, so it would be ready to buy as people came out of their houses. The common breakfast around here was a hot roll, with a smear of fat, or jam, or for the most prosperous, butter or butter <i>and</i> jam. By this time of the day, the bakeshops were closed, except to serve people who had left their dinners to be cooked for a fee as the ovens slowly cooled. If your hearth was tiny, or you didn&#x2019;t <i>have</i> a hearth, or you lived alone but couldn&#x2019;t afford to eat out of a cookshop every day, that is what you did for dinner. You made up a pot of something and brought it to the baker as you left for work, and picked up your cooked dinner when you returned home. This was <i>not</i> the poorest part of Haven, poor though it was&#x2014;those streets had the dubious distinction of being around the tanneries; where extremely cheap rents made up for the stinks associated with tanning leather. It was poor enough that quite often entire families crowded into a single room, or two and even three families shared a flat meant for one. The landlords didn&#x2019;t care how many people you squeezed in, as long as the rent got paid regularly.</p><p>Almost no one here owned the flats where they lived, unless they were the shop-owners, living above their shops. Shops in this street tended to stay open for as long as the owner could manage, or find someone to man the counter for him, since people here worked long and irregular hours. It wasn&#x2019;t uncommon to find a young child at the counter of many of these places, the offspring of the owner, learning the work of the business he or she would be inheriting by doing it.</p><p>It was only after dark&#x2014;and in the summertime, <i>well</i> after dark&#x2014;that these streets became dubious, even dangerous. Once the folks who worked for a living shut themselves behind their doors, the ones that lived in the shadows came out. After dark, when you heard shouts or noises, it didn&#x2019;t pay to be curious, unless you recognized the voice as that of one of the neighbors.</p><p>He was glad to reach the converted shop where his little horde of helpers lived, and even gladder to get the door open and pull it tightly shut behind him as a wave of welcome warmth struck him.</p><p>He turned and took in the room. He&#x2019;d had the building gutted when he bought it; since then, he and Minda had taken on so many littles that he&#x2019;d had a sleeping loft built around all four walls and a staircase to reach it. There were a couple of lamps up there, but nothing else but bedrolls and chests for clothing and trinkets. On the ground floor there were more bedrolls and chests, neatly stowed against the walls. There was only one real bed here, and that was the one reserved for &#x201c;Aunty&#x201d; Minda, who tended the children. There was a fireplace at the back of the room, nicely kitted out for cooking, and on either side of it, a row of buckets and basins for washing-up.</p><p>Two big kettles hung on hooks over the fire, both of them full of soup. Loaves of bread were waiting, stacked on a table beside the fire. Minda had the fires going briskly and the kettles pulled away from them so the soup didn&#x2019;t burn, as well she should, given the weather. She was virtually alone here at this hour, since her charges were all either at lessons or at work. Most of them were at work; most of them were messengers and delivery runners, installed at various taverns and inns around the city.</p><p>Minda was seated on a stool at the side of the hearth, stirring one of the kettles of soup. She rose to greet him; he was pleased to note that regular meals, reliable heat in the winter, rest, and the (relatively) easy work of mothering a brood of youngsters had vastly improved her health. She walked easily now, only slightly favoring knees that had been swollen from years of scrubbing floors. She looked like every other respectable lady around here; maybe cleaner than most, since she was fanatical about cleanliness now that she had the means to enforce it. Her woolen gown and heavy linen undergown were much mended, patched and faded, but not in tatters. Her kindly face was older than her years, but that was the case with just about everyone down here. &#x201c;All the littles are out, Master Harkon,&#x201d; Minda told him&#x2014;calling him by the name he used down here, Harkon, nephew of &#x201c;Willy the Weasel,&#x201d; who owned the pawn shop next door. She knew his real name of course, but no one here used it. Minda called all the youngsters &#x201c;littles,&#x201d; despite the fact that food and proper care had caused a few of them to sprout so fast they were as tall or taller than she was. And it was about three of those few he had come.</p><p>&#x201c;I got it set up, Aunty,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;Berk, Ray, an&#x2019; yer li&#x2019;l Sally&#x2019;r set up t&#x2019; go inter service up on th&#x2019; Hill. I&#x2019;ll come get &#x2019;em termorrow, an&#x2019; next week it&#x2019;ll be Starlin&#x2019;, Kip an&#x2019; Jo.&#x201d;</p><p>Minda sighed, and looked both sad and relieved. &#x201c;Well, th&#x2019; bigger lads ain&#x2019;t gettin&#x2019; th&#x2019; work as runners so much,&#x201d; she admitted, &#x201c;now thet they&#x2019;s tall as me. An&#x2019; we&#x2019;re getting a wee mite crowded here. An&#x2019; Sally&#x2019;ll be more&#x2019;n a girl soon, an&#x2019; ain&#x2019;t no place fer a girly wench here, &#x2019;mongst all these boys.&#x201d;</p><p>Mags nodded. Having a girl who&#x2019;d begun to bud woman-bits in a ramshackle &#x201c;household&#x201d; full of boys was just asking for trouble. Younglings <i>would</i> go experimenting when urges started, after all. And more likely to go experimenting among friends. &#x201c;Sally&#x2019;s t&#x2019;be i&#x2019; Palace itself. Gonna put her in trainin&#x2019; as lady&#x2019;s maid, all the airs and suchlike. She&#x2019;ll be mighty handy t&#x2019;me in a year or so, an put up in a room full&#x2019;f other liddle gels in the meantime, so safe as houses. She&#x2019;ll be gittin&#x2019; a day off ev&#x2019; fortnight t&#x2019;run down here an&#x2019; see ye.&#x201d;</p><p>Now Minda sighed with more than relief; she beamed to hear her &#x201c;daughter&#x201d; was going to be placed so well&#x2014;though Mags never had learned if Sally was really Minda&#x2019;s offspring, or someone the woman had just swept up the way a motherly cat will sweep up any kittens left orphaned. Minda would never have been able to <i>dream</i> of the girl going into service in the Palace before Mags had come along. The most she would have hoped for would have been that Sally could find a place in the kitchen of a tavern, or as a serving girl in an inn. And that would have been if she&#x2019;d been lucky.</p><p>&#x201c;Th&#x2019; lads &#x2019;re all gonna be placed as hall-boys &#x2019;round the highborn houses. I&#x2019;ll be keepin&#x2019; good track of &#x2019;em, an&#x2019; I&#x2019;ll get &#x2019;em out if they&#x2019;re treated bad. They&#x2019;ll be damn useful, you bet. Hall-boys hear &#x2019;bout ever&#x2019;thin&#x2019;.&#x201d; Mags was particularly pleased about that. The job of the hall-boy was quite literally to stay in a little cubicle shrouded by a curtain just off the front hall and answer the door so that visitors were never kept waiting more than a few moments. For the extremely wealthy families where he was getting his boys placed, it was a matter of pride to have a hall-boy that did <i>nothing but that</i>, day or night<i>.</i> He answered the door, got names and rank, and ran to get the steward so the visitors could be properly attended to. The hall-boy would know the names, rank, and business of every single person that came visiting, and would certainly be able to pick up pretty much everything in the way of gossip that he cared to.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, nobody could&#x2019;a ast better nor that,&#x201d; Minda agreed, bobbing her head. &#x201c;And t&#x2019;ain&#x2019;t gonna be no harder work than runnin&#x2019; messages all day.&#x201d; She took his elbow and drew him over to a second stool on the hearth. &#x201c;Now. Let&#x2019;s hev us a bit uv gossip.&#x201d;</p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�</p><p>Minda didn&#x2019;t have a lot of information for him, but Mags hadn&#x2019;t expected too much. Spring was the quiet season, at least until the Spring Fair. The highborn who only came to Court in the Winter were already on their way back to their estates, taking advantage of snow-free roads that were not yet axle-deep in mud due to spring rains. Merchants were busy planning their sales or purchases for the moment the weather turned warm. Farmers were hardest at work; it was already well into lambing season, and soon enough cattle and horses would start dropping babies. Anything that hadn&#x2019;t gotten mended over the winter would have to be put in shape to use once the ground softened enough to plow. Common folk were too busy at this season to get up to much mischief, and it was unlikely that his ears all over the city were going to hear anything. So what he got was a rough litany of minor affairs&#x2014;what prosperous fellow was sending presents and messages to a lady who was not his wife, what major robberies had taken place and who the likely perpetrator was, who had been seen in places he ought not to be.</p><p>He waited until the younglings began trickling in, and gave his chosen half-dozen the good news as they stood in line to wash hands and faces. And they took it as such.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; Sally cried, her cheeks turning pink with pleasure. &#x201c;I <i>am</i> going to be trained for a lady&#x2019;s maid, then! I am <i>so</i> glad!&#x201d;</p><p>Mags grinned; Sally was not only a bright little thing, she&#x2019;d been making concerted efforts at &#x201c;bettering&#x201d; her speech and her manners, drilling herself as well as studying with the Sisters of Nenya, ever since he&#x2019;d suggested he might be able to get her such a placing.</p><p>As for the boys, if their speech was a bit rougher than hers, that wouldn&#x2019;t matter at first; all that was asked of a hall-boy was that he be quick to answer the door, self-effacing, and able to pronounce names and say &#x201c;yes, milord&#x201d; or &#x201c;no, milord,&#x201d; properly. They&#x2019;d learn.</p><p>And all five of them had had occasion to see hall-boys at work, when Mags had sent them to various wealthy houses ostensibly delivering flowers or sweets at Midwinter. It was hard and often long work, since a hall-boy rarely had time off except to eat&#x2014;but it certainly was easier than spending all day running messages or parcels all over town.</p><p>He gave the first three their letters of introduction and the directions to the Palace Gate and the Great Houses where they would present themselves, and drilled them in exactly what they were to say when they turned up at the servant&#x2019;s entrance as near to sunrise as they could manage. When he was satisfied they would make a creditable impression, he patted each of them on the shoulder. &#x201c;Now, Sally, you&#x2019;re gonna be i&#x2019; the Palace. I&#x2019;ll be findin&#x2019; a way t&#x2019; talk to you about once a week, but if you hear somethin&#x2019; that&#x2019;s important, you find a way t&#x2019; get to the kitchen of Herald&#x2019;s Collegium and talk t&#x2019; the cook. &#x2019;E&#x2019;ll get me.&#x201d; As she nodded, he turned to the two boys. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have a harder time gettin&#x2019; away, so if <i>you</i> hear anythin&#x2019; I should know, take this&#x2014;&#x201d; he handed each of them a ball of red string &#x201c;&#x2014;an&#x2019; tie a piece t&#x2019; a tree near the servants&#x2019; door. I&#x2019;ll figger a reason t&#x2019; come callin&#x2019; as Herald Mags, and ye kin tell me what you&#x2019;ve got then.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You &#x2019;spect us to hear anything, Master Harkon?&#x201d; Berk asked curiously.</p><p>&#x201c;Honestly? Not really, no,&#x201d; Mags told them. &#x201c;At least not &#x2019;til yer well settled inter your jobs, and they&#x2019;ll give you leave t&#x2019; take an hour or two for yourselves now an&#x2019; again, an&#x2019; a regular day off. But I druther have a plan in place where you kin let me know we need t&#x2019; talk, than have you learn somethin&#x2019; then ruin all thet hard work I went to in order t&#x2019; git you in place by having t&#x2019; run off straight to me.&#x201d; He clapped both boys on the shoulders. &#x201c;So concentrate on settlin&#x2019; in, keepin&#x2019; yer minds on yer jobs an&#x2019; not on pretty chambermaids and handsome footmen, an&#x2019; not getting sacked!&#x201d;</p><p>All three of the youngsters grinned at him, but promised that they would do just that. For his part, Mags felt perfect confidence in them; they&#x2019;d already shown they were sharp and clever. They were ready for this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and Minda was right. The little refuge was beginning to get a bit crowded. It was time for the first of the lot to move on.</p><p>And he already had some ideas in mind for the next batch, after these six were safely in place.</p></p><h2>Continuity and Discontinuity: Perspectives on the Relationship Between the Old and New Testaments (Essays in Honor of S. Lewis Johnson, Jr.)</h2><p><p>Evangelicals agree that the Bible is God's inerrant word. But we sometimes differ on how to relate the messages of the Old and New Testaments. Without a basic understanding of this crucial matter, it is difficult to know how to use the Testaments to formulate either doctrine or practice.</p><p>For example: Was Israel the OT Church&#x2015;are OT promises to God's national people fulfilled in the church today? Or, is Mosaic Law binding on believers now&#x2015;are twentieth-century Christians to obey the Ten Commandments, including sabbath observance?</p><p>In this book, thirteen noted evangelical theologians discuss, fairly but clearly, the continuity/discontinuity debate in regard to six basic categories: theological systems, hermeneutics, salvation, the Law of God, the people of God, and kingdom promises.</p><p>Covering much more than the differences between Covenant Theology and Dispensationalism, this work of distinguished evangelical scholarship will fuel much profitable study and discussion.</p></p><p><p><strong>John S.

With extensive research and thoughtful chapter-by-chapter exegesis, Thielman leads readers through all aspects of the book of Ephesians--sociological, historical, and theological--to help them better understand its meaning and relevance. As with all BECNT volumes, this commentary features the author&#39;s detailed interaction with the Greek text and an acclaimed, user-friendly design. It admirably achieves the dual aims of the series--academic sophistication with pastoral sensitivity and accessibility.</p><p>"Frank Thielman's commentary on Paul's Letter to the Ephesians is exemplary for all who seek a deeper understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The careful historical exegesis, judicious exegetical decisions, and consistent concern to highlight the theology of the text make this an indispensable commentary."--<b>Eckhard J. Schnabel</b>, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>"Thielman's <i>Ephesians</i> admirably combines those features that distinguish excellent commentaries on Scripture: breadth of research in both classical and contemporary writings, careful attention to the form and structure of the Greek text, clear writing, and appropriate theological and practical application. This commentary will join Hoehner and O'Brien as the first references on Ephesians to which I turn."--<b>Douglas J. Moo</b>, Wheaton College<br><br>"Ephesians has been described as both the crown of Paul's Letters and a Waterloo for commentators. Calvin's favorite epistle, it joyfully celebrates the grace of God and the love of Christ in all their fullness. Thielman's commentary plumbs its depths and is a model of informed and lucid interpretation. Like its subject, it is rich and edifying and repays careful reading."--<b>Brian S. Rosner</b>, Moore Theological College<br><br>"An excellent example of how a high regard for the authority of Scripture can be combined with thorough historical, linguistic, scholarly work. Thielman takes seriously all the major challenges critical scholarship has marshaled in regard to the authorship and date of Ephesians, yet he argues convincingly that Paul has written this epistle to the Christians in Ephesus during his imprisonment in Rome. The strength of the commentary lies in the author's close attention to the text's structure, Greek style, and theological content."--<b>Peter Balla</b>, K�roli G�sp�r University of the Reformed Church in Hungary<br><br>"Thielman manages an extraordinary feat: a commentary that is thorough, historically astute, and written in engaging, conversational prose. Rarely does one come away from a commentary thinking that it was a delight to read, but Thielman pulls it off brilliantly.

The most well-known episode in the eviction of American Indians in the East was the notorious &#x201c;Trail of Tears&#x201d; along which Southeastern Indians were driven from their homes in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to reservations in present-day Oklahoma. But the struggle in the South was part of a wider story that reaches back in time to the closing months of the War of 1812, back through many states&#x2014;most notably Ohio&#x2014;and into the lives of so many tribes, including the Delaware, Seneca, Shawnee, Ottawa, and Wyandot (Huron). They, too, were forced to depart from their homes in the Ohio Country to Kansas and Oklahoma. <i>The Other Trail of Tears: The Removal of the Ohio Indians</i> by award-winning historian Mary Stockwell tells the story of this region&#x2019;s historic tribes as they struggled following the death of Tecumseh and the unraveling of his tribal confederacy in 1813. At the peace negotiations in Ghent in 1814, Great Britain was unable to secure a permanent homeland for the tribes in Ohio setting the stage for further treaties with the United States and encroachment by settlers. Over the course of three decades the Ohio Indians were forced to move to the West, with the Wyandot people ceding their last remaining lands in Ohio to the U.S. Government in the early 1850s. The book chronicles the history of Ohio&#x2019;s Indians and their interactions with settlers and U.S. agents in the years leading up to their official removal, and sheds light on the complexities of the process, with both individual tribes and the United States taking advantage of opportunities at different times. It is also the story of how the native tribes tried to come to terms with the fast pace of change on America&#x2019;s western frontier and the inevitable loss of their traditional homelands. While the tribes often disagreed with one another, they attempted to move toward the best possible future for all their people against the relentless press of settlers and limited time.</p></p><p>MARY STOCKWELL received her Ph.D. in American history from the University of Toledo and was professor of history and department chair at Lourdes University. Most recently she was an Earhart Foundation Fellow at the William L. Clements Library, University of Michigan.

In this opus about the Holy Spirit, Evangelist Reinhard Bonnke gives you the secret to his success-the fire of the Holy Spirit. Bonnke has compiled some of the greatest uncompromising truths about the Holy Spirit that have been at the cornerstone of his ministry for over 50 years. Birthed in critical times and seasons on the mission field, these truths-Holy Spirit Fire Points-capture deep lessons about the Holy Spirit that are non-negotiable for the believer or minister desiring to move in the supernatural power and gifts of the Holy Spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> In this book, you will encounter the faith and pneumatology of Reinhard Bonnke-a refreshing and invigorating perspective of the Holy Spirit that will challenge your thinking on the activity of the third person of the Trinity. If you want a vibrant, fruitful ministry or Christian walk, then this book is a must read. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is still the key to lighting the globe with the fires of evangelism, and our knowledge of, response to and faith in the person, presence and power of the Holy Spirit is the transformative difference.&nbsp;</p><p>Evangelist Reinhard Bonnke is principally known for his Great Gospel Crusades throughout the Continent of Africa. The son of a pastor, Reinhard gave his life to the Lord at age nine, and heard the call to the African mission field before he was even a teenager. After attending Bible College in Wales, and his ordination in Germany he pastored a church and then went on to start missionary work in Africa. It was there, in the small mountain kingdom of Lesotho, that God placed upon his heart the vision of &#39;the continent of Africa, being washed in the precious Blood of Jesus&#39; - an entire continent, from Cape Town to Cairo and from Dakar to Djibouti that needed to be reached and to hear the proclamation of the signs-following Gospel.</p><h2>We March</h2><p><p>On August 28, 1963, a remarkable event took place--more than 250,000 people gathered in our nation's capital to participate in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The march began at the Washington Monument and ended with a rally at the Lincoln Memorial, where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his historic "I Have a Dream" speech, advocating racial harmony. Many words have been written about that day, but few so delicate and powerful as those presented here by award-winning author and illustrator Shane W. Evans. When combined with his simple yet compelling illustrations, the thrill of the day is brought to life for even the youngest reader to experience.</p><p><i>We March </i>is one of <i>Kirkus Reviews' </i>Best Children's Books of 2012</p></p><p><p>Shane W. Evans has illustrated numerous books for children, including <i>Black Jack: The Ballad of Jack Johnson</i> and <i>Underground</i>, recipient of four starred reviews, both for Roaring Brook Press. He lives with his family in Kansas City, Missouri.</p>As he did in Underground (2011), Evans distills a critical moment in the fight for racial equality&#x2014;the 1963 March on Washington&#x2014;into tight, evocative prose, well calibrated for a very young audience. A boy, a girl, and their parents wake at dawn, prepare, travel, and join a march &#x201c;to justice, to freedom, to our dreams.&#x201d; The text itself, but 57 words, tells the story in a clear first-person-plural voice that begins with the young family and soon encompasses the entire assembly. The simplicity of the narrative is matched by Evans&#x2019; square, substantial, sunlit paintings, which&#x2014;with wheelchairs, yarmulkes, and all manner of skin tone&#x2014;are especially inclusive. The illustrations also depict recognizable faces (Mathew Ahmann, Floyd McKissick, Martin Luther King Jr., and Cleveland Robinson) and iconic landmarks on the National Mall, and conclude with Dr. King delivering the &#x201c;I Have a Dream&#x201d; speech with the words &#x201c;Free at last!&#x201d; This makes a pivotal event in our nation&#x2019;s history accessible to our youngest citizens without compromising any of its power.

Macdonald&#x2019;s pioneering use of fanstasy as a literary medium had a great influence on Lewis Carroll, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Madeleine L&#x2019;Engle, all great admirers of his work, which has remained popular to this day. "I write, not for children," he wrote, "but for the child-like, whether they be of five, or fifty, or seventy-five."This edition includes illustrations by Arthur Hughes.</p><p>As always with George MacDonald, everything here is more than meets the eye: this in fact is MacDonald's grace-filled vision of the world. Said to be one of J.R.R. Tolkien's childhood favorites, <i>The Princess and the Goblin</i> is the story of the young Princess Irene, her good friend Curdie--a minor's son--and Irene's mysterious and beautiful great great grandmother, who lives in a secret room at the top of the castle stairs. Filled with images of dungeons and goblins, mysterious fires, burning roses, and a thread so fine as to be invisible and yet--like prayer--strong enough to lead the Princess back home to her grandmother's arms, this is a story of Curdie's slow realization that sometimes, as the princess tells him, "you must believe without seeing." Simple enough for reading aloud to a child (as I've done myself more than once with my daughter), it's rich enough to repay endless delighted readings for the adult. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i>George Macdonald (1824-1905) was born at Huntly, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, where his father was a miller and his family Congregationalists. As a young man he was ordained a minister of the Congregational church but he resigned after a disagreement with his deacons over doctrine, and from 1853 he earned his living by lecturing and writing, often in poor health, which meant periodic travelling in search of purer air for his lungs. In 1851 he married Louisa Powell, with whom he spent a long and happy life, sadly ending in grief when three of his thirteen children died of tuberculosis and he suffered a stroke that deprived him of speech for his last five years. He was a prolific writer, yet it is his fantasies for children that have survived. <b>The Princess and the Goblin</b> was the second of these, published first as a serial in <i>Good Words for the Young</i>, a periodical of which he became editor for a short time in 1869. About a hundred years later W.H. Auden wrote, 'To me, George MacDonald's most extraordinary, and precious, gift is his ability, in all his stories, to create an atmosphere of goodness about which there is nothing phone or moralistic.

In this collection of essays, poems, congressional testimony, and journal entries (some previously published), she ruminates on the meaning of wilderness and the need to preserve it as a way to save ourselves as much as the land itself. In <i>Red</i>, she lends an elegant and passionate voice to the growing "Coyote Clan" in southern Utah--"hundreds, maybe even thousands, of individuals who are quietly subversive on behalf of the land"--along with the many others ideologically in step with this movement. She also discusses those deeply resentful of active environmentalists as well as those seething at the U.S. government for the way it manages millions of acres of western land, writing that "Federal control in the American West remains an open wound." Some of these contrary voices even come from within her own clan, a reality she describes in an essay in which she gently debates the merits of the Endangered Species Act with her father and other family members who own and operate a construction company in Utah. <p> A beloved nature writer and environmental voice, Williams writes emotionally and even erotically of her relationship with the red-rock landscape surrounding her home outside Moab, closely analyzing the wildlife, human characters, and Anasazi petroglyphs of this magical, arid region. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>The beloved author of "Refuge, Terry Tempest Williams is one of the country's most eloquent and imaginative writers.

But today's well-known personalities make up the second generation of broadcasting and publishing activists. <i>Messengers of the Right</i> tells the story of the little-known first generation.</p><p>Beginning in the late 1940s, activists working in media emerged as leaders of the American conservative movement. They not only started an array of enterprises&#x2014;publishing houses, radio programs, magazines, book clubs, television shows&#x2014;they also built the movement. They coordinated rallies, founded organizations, ran political campaigns, and mobilized voters. While these media activists disagreed profoundly on tactics and strategy, they shared a belief that political change stemmed not just from ideas but from spreading those ideas through openly ideological communications channels.</p><p>In <i>Messengers of the Right</i>, Nicole Hemmer explains how conservative media became the institutional and organizational nexus of the conservative movement, transforming audiences into activists and activists into a reliable voting base. Hemmer also explores how the idea of liberal media bias emerged, why conservatives have been more successful at media activism than liberals, and how the right remade both the Republican Party and American news media. <i>Messengers of the Right</i> follows broadcaster Clarence Manion, book publisher Henry Regnery, and magazine publisher William Rusher as they evolved from frustrated outsiders in search of a platform into leaders of one of the most significant and successful political movements of the twentieth century.</p></p><p>Nicole Hemmer is Assistant Professor of Presidential Studies at the University of Virginia&#39;s Miller Center.<p>Preface</p><p>"My project this summer is to get you to vote for George Bush."</p><p>My father's declaration, made one June day in 2004 as we were driving into town, did not surprise me. I was back in Indiana for my annual visit, and my dad and I had spent every day since my arrival wrangling over American politics: the war in Iraq, the marriage equality referenda, the impending election. Raised conservative, I had slowly slid to the left as my dad drifted further right. But that divergence ended up drawing us closer together. Political debate became the secret language of our relationship, the way we conveyed love, respect, disagreement, and admiration. So there was nothing extraordinary about an afternoon spent debating politics. Yet I remember every contour of that particular conversation&#x2014;the conviction in my dad's voice, the soft hum of traffic, the breeze stirring the Ohio Valley's stagnant summer air&#x2014;because of what he did next.</p><p>He turned on the radio.</p><p>Our conversation was replaced with the sound of the <i>Rush Limbaugh Show</i>, and then the <i>Sean Hannity Show</i>. Wherever we went that summer, the radio offered up a steady stream of conservative talk. I found it both grating and captivating, a heady mix of personality and passion and politics. During ad breaks we feasted on each segment's arguments and insights, dissecting the surprisingly wide variety of philosophies and logics (and illogics) at play. In addition to engaging from my own adversarial perspective, I observed my dad's response as a sympathetic listener. He absorbed some arguments, rejected others, and refashioned still others to fit with his life experiences. This dynamic interplay confounded the common stereotype of talk-radio listeners as sponges soaking up the host's message. It was compelling stuff. And while it didn't change my vote, it did change my life&#x2014;and led to the book you're reading now.</p><p>Some months later, while skimming through back issues of the <i>Nation</i> magazine, I spotted an article called "Hate Clubs of the Air." It began, "Right-wing fanatics, casting doubt on the loyalty of every president of the United States since Herbert Hoover, are pounding the American people, this Presidential election year, with an unprecedented flood of radio and television propaganda." The article's existence refuted everything I thought I knew about conservative media. The long-accepted narrative said that the modern conservative movement started with intellectuals in the 1950s, took root in organizations in the 1960s and 1970s, and won political influence in the 1980s. Only then did a powerful and influential conservative media apparatus emerge, first in talk radio and then in cable news. Yet here was a liberal journalist disparaging right-wing radio and television in 1964. I had to find out more.</p><p>With this discovery, I made my way into the archives. There I uncovered a network of activism far broader and far more influential than I had expected. Beginning in the late 1940s and 1950s, activists working in media emerged as leaders of the conservative movement. Not only did they start an array of media enterprises&#x2014;publishing houses, radio programs, magazines, book clubs, television shows&#x2014;they built the movement. They coordinated rallies, founded organizations, ran political campaigns, and mobilized voters. From the archives they emerged as a distinct group that I call "media activists," men and women (but mostly men) whose primary sites of activism were the media institutions they founded. While they disagreed profoundly on tactics and strategy, they shared a belief that political change stemmed not just from ideas but from the proper expression and diffusion of those ideas through ideological media sources. Unlike fellow conservatives who worked for mainstream periodicals and broadcasters, these media activists believed independence was vital to their work&#x2014;that they needed to develop their own publishing houses, their own radio programs, their own magazines if they were going to truly change American politics.</p><p>This idea of conservative media activism no doubt resonates with anyone who has followed U.S. politics in the past few decades. Americans are accustomed to thinking of right-wing media as integral to contemporary conservatism. In 2009 Rush Limbaugh topped polls as the de facto leader of the Republican Party. Tea Party rallies in 2009 and 2010 featured Fox News personalities and popular radio hosts. But these well-known figures comprise the second generation of media activists. <i>Messengers of the Right</i> tells the story of the little-known first generation. It explains how conservative media became the institutional and organizational nexus of the movement, transforming audiences into activists and activists into a reliable voting base. It follows broadcaster Clarence Manion, book publisher Henry Regnery, and magazine publisher William Rusher as they evolved from frustrated outsiders in search of a platform into leaders of one of the most significant and successful political movements of the twentieth century.</p><p>Manion's and Regnery's stories start in the 1930s. Both held positions within the New Deal&#x2014;political conversions abound in <i>Messengers of the Right</i>&#x2014;but ultimately broke with the Roosevelt administration over foreign policy. In the meeting rooms of the America First Committee, these men spoke out against intervention and began building relationships that would launch their media careers. Regnery joined <i>Human Events</i>, founded by a number of former America Firsters in 1944 as the war began winding down. In 1947 he left to start his own publishing company. Manion remained in mainstream politics until 1954 when he was fired from the Eisenhower administration over his support of the Bricker Amendment (a national-sovereignty proposal). Both began using new media platforms to make arguments against the New Deal, the war, and containment, their independence rooted in the belief that there was a concerted effort by the mainstream media to block out conservative ideas. They criticized bipartisanship as well as what they saw as an ingrained liberal bias in media and the academy. Rusher remained part of Republican politics until the mid-1950s, when Eisenhower's censure of Joseph McCarthy convinced him that not even Republicans would take a tough enough stance against communism. Soon these media activists found themselves called to organize grassroots conservatives and to enter electoral politics. Originally intent on building mouthpieces, they ended up building a movement.</p><p>Conservative media activism has not been absent from the many histories of modern conservatism. George Nash's classic <i>The Conservative Intellectual Movement</i>, written in 1976, is rife with right-wing writers and journalists and editors. Rick Perlstein's 2001 book <i>Before the Storm</i>, a history of the conservative movement to 1964, begins with a chapter on the Manionites, named after right-wing radio host Clarence Manion. There are at least three biographies of William F. Buckley Jr., the wunderkind founder of <i>National Review</i>. Media-centered activists appear again and again in histories of conservative economic thought, grassroots organizing, and political campaigning. Yet no one has yet studied them as a coherent network of activists or looked at what it meant for the movement that media activists were its architects.</p><p>The consequences of their leadership were profound. First and foremost: media activists crafted and popularized the idea of liberal media bias. This concept&#x2014;that established media were not neutral but slanted toward liberalism&#x2014;not only shaped the movement but remade American journalism. We have grown so used to this claim that it is hard to comprehend just how radical an idea it was in the 1940s and 1950s. After all, this was an era when institutional neutrality was considered the special genius of the American system. In a world roiling with the terrors of fascism, totalitarianism, and communism, American politicians and intellectuals celebrated the technocratic state and its attendant institutions as spaces free from the passions and pitfalls of ideology. To wit: two years after the publication of Harvard sociologist Daniel Bell's 1960 book <i>The End of Ideology</i>, President John F. Kennedy declared that the major domestic challenges of the era "do not relate to the basic clashes of philosophy and ideology, but to the ways and means of reaching common goals." His belief in a national consensus pursued through dispassionate management rather than ideological clashes was a broadly shared faith.</p><p>Shared, that is, by those who saw themselves as part of what historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. in 1949 called "the vital center." Schlesinger (who wrote Kennedy's 1962 speech) chastised those on both the left and the right who did not hew to this agreed-upon middle, which viewed New Deal domestic policies and liberal anticommunism as the only viable Cold War position. This consensus was, paradoxically, understood as both liberal and nonideological. Such an understanding could only be sustained from within the vital center. Viewed from the progressive left or the conservative right, the neutrality of the vital center was a farce. Activists on the left and the right found themselves tarred as extremists and ideologues, politically illegitimate in a post-ideology age. Both sought to expose the ideological agendas of these purportedly neutral institutions, attacking the press's claims of objectivity, the universities' claims of neutrality, and the government's claims of technocracy. But it was conservatives who had the greatest impact, convincing not just the right but a plurality of Americans that mainstream institutions were biased in favor of liberalism.</p><p>For conservative media activists, the concept of "liberal bias" was both a lived reality and a rhetorical argument. It was central to their understanding of institutions as inherently ideological. They embedded their ideas about media in the organizations they founded and the political campaigns they led. They taught a generation of conservatives to reject nonconservative media and to seek out right-wing news sources. In the process, they made this habit of conservative media consumption part of what it now means to be a conservative in America.</p><p>This reliance on ideological media also reshaped the conservative relationship to ideas. The story I tell about conservative media activism from the 1940s through the 1970s is not just one of media spreading political ideas but media opening a battle over how best to assess what is true and what is not. Conservatives took up this battle against the dominant journalistic mode of midcentury America: objectivity. Some have argued that "objectivity" describes a set of professional practices rather than a coherent worldview, but this understates the power of objectivity as a concept. Objectivity was more than a set of professional values&#x2014;it was a claim about the best way to understand the world. In midcentury, American journalists who were invested in the ideal of objectivity claimed the trueness of their stories could best be evaluated by how well they adhered to standards of disinterestedness, accuracy, factuality, fairness, and, less overtly but no less importantly, their deference to official information and institutional authority.</p><p>Conservative media activists advanced an alternative way of knowing the world, one that attacked the legitimacy of objectivity and substituted for it ideological integrity. That attack was embodied in their notion of "liberal media bias," which disputed not just the content presented by mainstream journalists but the very claims they made about their objective practices. This was a battle over fundamentals, a struggle over how best to assess the trustworthiness of information. Media activists weren't suggesting there existed a world of objective media that they rejected and a world of ideological media that they promoted. They were arguing there was no such thing as nonideological media, that objectivity was a mask mainstream media used to hide their own ideological projects.</p><p>In making this claim, conservative media activists in midcentury America provided their audiences&#x2014;readers, listeners, and viewers&#x2014;with a different way of weighing evidence: a different network of authorities, a different conception of fact and accuracy, and a different way of evaluating truth-claims. That evaluation relied not on the source's impartiality but on the assumed biases of the writers, editors, and publishers involved in the media enterprise. The assumption that all media outlets were biased and were engaged in the same type of ideological warfare allowed conservatives to develop a robust approach to absorbing contrary evidence. When an outlet like the <i>New York Times</i> criticized a liberal policy, conservative media activists presented it not as evidence of the paper's even-handedness but as evidence of the policy's failure. Even the liberal New York Times<i> had to admit. . . . Thus evidence that seemed to undermine the charge of liberal bias could be reinterpreted to support the conservative claim.</i></p><p><i>Media bias was not the only artifact of the conservative claim that institutions were inherently ideological. Through their critique of an entrenched liberal establishment, the first generation of conservative media activists developed an oppositional identity that enabled conservatives to identify as outsiders. They cultivated what we can usefully think of as an "elite populism," which allowed media activists to speak as representatives of an oppressed minority (and by the mid-1960s, an oppressed majority), despite their access to traditional sources of economic, social, and political power. Theirs was not simply a story of grassroots activists agitating for change or a story of well-placed elites manipulating the masses. Rather, the work of media activists sat at the intersection of these two factions.</i></p><p><i>Elite populism was a distinguishing feature of conservative media activism from the start. Though the "elite" part was seldom in question, the "populist" part took a while to fully develop. When their activism was simply a matter of formulating arguments and creating a sense of conservative identity among far-flung readers and listeners, it didn't particularly matter if they represented a minority. Populism flavored their work but functioned largely as a linkage to the past. This first generation of media activists saw themselves operating in a populist tradition that extended back to the American founding. They compared their work to that of Thomas Paine, raising the cry of revolution while laying the groundwork for a fundamentally new type of government, and to that of William Lloyd Garrison, demanding an end to slavery at a time when abolitionism was considered at best eccentric and at worst seditious. Drawn to iconoclasts, media activists constructed a lineage that was as radical as it was conservative. If the establishment was liberal, then they would dedicate themselves to demolishing it.</i></p><p><i>But with Barry Goldwater's landslide loss to Lyndon Johnson in the presidential campaign of 1964 it became painfully clear these activists would have to forge a conservative majority. Populism offered a way forward because it allow...</i></p></p><h2>Unbreakable: A Navy SEAL&#39;s Way of Life</h2><p><strong>A highly decorated Navy SEAL shares stories of his years of combat experience in Afghanistan, providing leadership insights that will shift your view of yourself and provoke life-altering change. <br><br></strong>Before leaving for combat in Afghanistan, Navy SEAL Thom Shea promised his wife that he would write to his children in case he didn't make it back.

His legs were stretched straight out in a V on either side of the roof&#x2019;s ridge. He would have preferred a flat surface, but the advantages of this location easily outweighed any drawbacks. From this angle, he had an unobstructed view of the road through the Zeiss scope.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He waited. When the moment arrived, he would place the pad of his right index finger on the trigger rather than the crease between the first and second joints.

Only the sniper&#x2019;s freelance work, like this assignment, bought him the good life&#x2014;a nice car, good clothes, new furniture. And women, of course.<br><br>� � �<br>Political rallies in Ghana are a serious business. There&#x2019;s blaring music, dancing troupes, and handkerchief-waving groups of women in matching outfits. Gangs of ferocious biker youths careen erratically through the streets, sometimes colliding with cars and each other, but these excitable young men, their bodies soused with adrenaline, leap right back up and keep riding.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it was for Bernard Evans-Aidoo campaigning in the city of Sekondi-Takoradi against incumbent President Bannerman. Big, charismatic, and dressed flamboyantly in his signature red, black, white, and green&#x2014;the colors of the National Democratic Congress party, the NDC. Evans-Aidoo stood out of the sunroof of his black Benz and waved to the thrilled crowds lining Shippers Council Road. A full brass band, rocking and high-stepping in rhythmic unison, preceded the slow-moving vehicle, and behind the car was a bunch of random kids and teenagers whirling and jumping up and down with unspecified exuberance. Every so often, the Benz paused and Evans-Aidoo got out with surprising agility to press palms with his fans. He saw the worshipping, idolizing expression in their eyes as they stretched out their hands to be blessed by his touch.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the candidate&#x2019;s third stop for the day: Axim, Tarkwa, and now Sekondi-Takoradi. There had been the inevitable delays at the two prior rallies and Evans-Aidoo and the entourage were late. Even though they had started the parade before dusk, darkness had descended quickly around 6 p.m., as it always does at the equator. But that was no impediment. The campaign had a vehicle with a generator and bright lights that traveled at the head of the procession, sharply spotlighting the popular man who had set the youth on fire with his promises. He had pledged first, to sack every single corrupt official in the Bannerman government; second, to shunt away some of Ghana&#x2019;s petroleum and natural gas revenue into programs that would benefit ordinary men and women, particularly the largely unemployed youth. It was a classic taking from the rich to give to the poor. These young people, so hungry for a livelihood, truly loved Evans-Aidoo, and they had waited for him for hours in the ferocious sun. Now he was here, and he didn&#x2019;t disappoint as he put on this dazzling show. He was larger than life physically and symbolically.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cacophony from the cheering crowds, the band, and the noisy mobile generator prevented anyone from hearing a distinct gunshot. Evans-Aidoo&#x2019;s body dropped so suddenly from view that few people grasped that anything was wrong.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But inside the Benz, terror unfolded. Evans-Aidoo had collapsed like a sack of yams into the lap of his campaign manager, who let out a high-pitched scream as the minister&#x2019;s blood sprayed her and the tan leather seats. The bodyguard in the front scrambled into the back seat to shield his boss. The chauffeur craned to look behind. &#x201c;What happened? What happened?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>&#x201c;Drive forward!&#x201d;</i> the bodyguard shouted. <i>&#x201c;Drive!&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Benz shot forward and crossed the street&#x2019;s center line. Tires squealing, it skirted the generator vehicle and kept going. People at the roadside were screaming, but it was not jubilation anymore. It was panic. Something bad had happened, but no one knew exactly what.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The manager in the Benz was shrieking, her head turned away from the sight of Evans-Aidoo limp and half wedged behind the passenger seat. The bodyguard tried to lift his boss&#x2019;s head, but it was slick with blood and brain matter and it slipped from his hands.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hyperventilating and gripping the steering wheel like death itself, the chauffeur said, &#x201c;Where? Where?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Takoradi Hospital,&#x201d; the bodyguard stammered. He was close to weeping. <i>&#x201c;Hurry!&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>TWO</b><br> <b><i>January 3, Accra, Ghana</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> With darkened windows, sirens going, and small flags of Ghana flapping on their hoods, three shiny, black SUVs raced along Independence Avenue. Ordinary mortals on the street knew the drill and pulled their vehicles to the side to give the VIP free passage.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the dignitary taking precedence over the plebes of Accra was the Inspector General of Police, James Akrofi, who was in the back seat of the middle vehicle. He didn&#x2019;t look up from his work as he made last-minute changes to the draft of his Ghana Police Service Report to the Blue-Ribbon Commission on the Eradication of Corruption in Ghana. It was a mouthful, but before President J. K. Bannerman had been elected to power almost four years ago by an overwhelming majority of Ghanaian voters, he had campaigned consistently on that one bedeviling issue: corruption. Tapping into a lurking sense among Ghana&#x2019;s citizens that the nation was slipping backward like a truck mired in muck, Bannerman had persuaded Ghanaians that corruption was standing in the way of every individual&#x2019;s development and prosperity. &#x201c;Ghana fails when corruption prevails,&#x201d; his albeit clumsy slogan, had caught on. Bannerman had promised the nation a new era of The Clean and Enlightened Society. The people reached out to him with the fervor of a parched man in the Sahara yearning for an oasis.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest, like the engine of an antique car, the anti-corruption machine had been slow to start. Now, as Bannerman&#x2019;s first term was ending and the political parties were revving up for the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections at the end of the year, the president&#x2019;s track record had been spotty&#x2014;some even said too little, too late. There was some truth to the characterization that implementation was not Bannerman&#x2019;s strong suit and that he was more of an idealist than a pragmatist. Privately, Akrofi thought the truth was somewhere in the middle. The bottom line was that Bannerman was now vulnerable to one man: Bernard Evans-Aidoo.<br>� � �<br>The SUV convoy swept through the gates of Jubilee House and sped across the vast square toward the presidential palace, which was built in the shape of the golden stool of the Asantehene. The Office of the President was expecting Akrofi, so from the Palace entrance to the final security door of President Bannerman&#x2019;s inner sanctum, passage was quick and all the checkpoints along the way essentially a formality. Everyone knew who the IGP was: one of Bannerman&#x2019;s closest friends and advisors.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, 63, had a stern but avuncular demeanor, his charcoal ash hair suggesting wisdom. He strode forward, hand outstretched. &#x201c;James! <i>Ete sen?</i>&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;<i>Nyame adom</i>, J. K.,&#x201d; Akrofi said, grasping the hand with a firm, enthusiastic grip. Their eyes met and held, a testament to the strong bond between them.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Good to see you, good to see you,&#x201d; Bannerman said. &#x201c;Come, let&#x2019;s sit down.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Akrofi followed the president several meters across the crimson carpet with Ghana&#x2019;s coat of arms in the center. They had a 360-degree view of Accra through the tinted, floor-to-ceiling bulletproof glass, the cost of which had no doubt contributed to the bloated $50 million cost of the palace. But Akrofi didn&#x2019;t find that necessarily bad. In what country was it not fashionable to complain about the extravagant residences of the ruling class?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of respect, Akrofi waited for the leader of the nation to sit down before he did. &#x201c;How are dear Josephine and the children?&#x201d; Bannerman asked, turning his body halfway toward his friend.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Everybody is doing well, by His Grace, thank you,&#x201d; Akrofi said. &#x201c;Josephine is in DC at the moment winning friends and influencing people, so to speak, and then she will be in England to see Kwame.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bannerman&#x2019;s expression softened. &#x201c;How is he doing these days?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Akrofi lowered his gaze with a touch of sadness. &#x201c;You know. He has his good and bad days.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes, of course. I have faith that one day he will be well by God&#x2019;s grace.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Thank you, J. K. I appreciate your good wishes.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You are always welcome,&#x201d; Bannerman said. &#x201c;So, let&#x2019;s see what you have for me.&#x201d; Akrofi handed him the folder with the report and the president read it through once.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Outstanding,&#x201d; he said at length. &#x201c;This is simply first class and I like your four-part plan to eliminate corruption at the top. I think you&#x2019;ve done a lot to change the culture of middle management and the junior officers, but now it&#x2019;s time to target the upper echelons.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You have my sincere word I will endeavor to do so,&#x201d; Akrofi said. &#x201c;I admire what you are trying to do for the country.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He and Bannerman had been in law school together, and high school and college before that. Akrofi had heavily supported his friend&#x2019;s presidential campaign and Bannerman had promised him the IGP post in return. One didn&#x2019;t rise to that position. It was a civilian appointment made entirely at the president&#x2019;s wishes. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bannerman rose to place the documents on his rosewood desk imported from Italy, and then turned to the view from the southwest window. Accra&#x2019;s afternoon traffic was as clogged as bad plumbing. From here, one could just see the roof of the Ghana Police Service headquarters. On the other side of the double-lane Ring Road East, several embassies nestled among the trees.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Akrofi came to stand beside the president.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You and I are cut from the same cloth,&#x201d; Bannerman said quietly. &#x201c;So, you understand how much I want this. Obviously, I can&#x2019;t abolish corruption completely, but I want Ghanaians to come to regard it in a different way&#x2014;as a kind of cancer that has metastasized to all parts of society. Now it must be surgically removed everywhere it is found. Then things will begin to change.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Akrofi nodded. &#x201c;I do understand.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We will drum anti-corruption into the Ghanaian psyche,&#x201d; Bannerman said. &#x201c;Billboards, radio, TV, social media. I&#x2019;ll have rappers and football players endorse the plan. With their help, I&#x2019;ll create a new consciousness.&#x201d; He looked at Akrofi. &#x201c;We are warriors against a worthy foe, but together, we can vanquish.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;By &#x2018;worthy foe&#x2019; you mean corruption? Or Evans-Aidoo?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Corruption. Evans-Aidoo can&#x2019;t sustain his position in the polls. This business about him redistributing oil wealth to the citizens is nonsense. We are not Norway.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No country is&#x2014;except Norway,&#x201d; Akrofi said with a wry smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a little concerned about him though, because his followers believe him and there are more and more of them every day. It&#x2019;s all false hope, for sure, but the nature of people is that they cling to that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Akrofi waited for his friend to respond. Instead, Bannerman turned away with his head down and hands thrust deeply in his pockets. Akrofi had an awful foreboding that if Bernard Evans-Aidoo wasn&#x2019;t stopped, Bannerman&#x2019;s presidency would be over.</p><h2>Montauk Revisited: Adventures in Synchronicity (The Montauk, Book 2)</h2><p>Book II in the Montauk series unmasks the occult forces that were behind the science and technology used in the Montauk Project.

Peggy has consulted on library development in Uganda, Rwanda, Senegal, Morocco, and China.In recent years, books about electronic resources have greatly outnumbered those covering collection development. Fortunately, Johnson has answered this shortcoming. In nine chapters, she covers the entire field of collection development, from its history to collection analysis to marketing. She succinctly discusses ways to organize and staff for selection, how to write collection plans and budgets, how to manage collections, and how to set up cooperative collection plans with other libraries. The book closes with an appendix listing selection aids, a glossary, and an index of names and subjects. Invaluable to library students and beginning librarians, this book also has helpful ideas and information for even seasoned collections librarians. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But the true reason for his disguise is far more chilling: he has developed a process that has made him invisible, and is locked in a struggle to discover the antidote. Forced from the village and driven to murder, he seeks the aid of his old friend Kemp. The horror of his fate has affected his mind, however - and when Kemp refuses to help, Griffin resolves to wreak his revenge.

Wells&#34; series from McFarland.A gripping and entertaining tale of terror and suspense as well as a potent Faustian allegory of hubris and science run amok, &#34;The Invisible Man endures as one of the signature stories in the literature of science fiction. A brilliant scientist uncovers the secret to invisibility, but his grandiose dreams and the power he unleashes cause him to spiral into intrigue, madness, and murder. The inspiration for countless imitations and film adaptations, &#34;The Invisible Man is as remarkable and relevant today as it was a hundred years ago. As Arthur C. Clarke points out in his Introduction, &#34;The interest of the story . . . lies not in its scientific concepts, but in the brilliantly worked out development of the theme of invisibility.

I wondered if he could tell that I&#x2019;d faked my stockings and that my seams had been drawn on with an eyebrow pencil. I tucked one leg behind the other, hoping to hide my ingenuity.</p><p>It was Friday night and I was at the Five Star, sitting next to this nameless man who&#x2019;d just bought me my second bourbon. Glancing at my fingers, peppered with paper cuts and ribbon stains, I closed my eyes, trying to ease the headache I&#x2019;d had since Tuesday. A chorus of Smith Coronas striking letterhead and the ping of two dozen carriage returns going back and forth nonstop echoed inside my head. I had just survived my first week as a typewriter for the insurance offices of Schlemmer Weiss &amp; Unger. The job was dull&#x2014;a real flat tire&#x2014;and the pay was lousy. Of the twenty dollars I got in my weekly salary envelope, eight had already been grabbed by my landlady when I stopped by the rooming house to change out of my work clothes. I didn&#x2019;t know how twelve dollars would carry me until my next payday, but I refused to admit that my mother was right. I was eighteen years old. Other girls my age got jobs and lived on their own. They managed. I&#x2019;d find a way, too.</p><p>I took another sip of bourbon. It went down easy, smooth as Coca-Cola. I&#x2019;d been in only a handful of speakeasies but I could see why they were so popular. Everyone was smiling and laughing, having a swell time. From the get-go, anyone with half a brain could have told you Prohibition wasn&#x2019;t going to prohibit a damn thing. It only added to the allure of that forbidden fruit. People who didn&#x2019;t even like to drink before 1920 now knocked on unmarked doors, whispered their way inside and lingered over rows of gin and whiskey bottles lined up like tin soldiers. If the Volstead Act had outlawed chewing gum instead of liquor, what do you think we would have chomped on with our friends, spent our last dollar on, and kept hidden in our garters? We always want what&#x2019;s just outside our reach.</p><p>But Prohibition and speakeasies aside, I was no stranger to liquor.</p><p>&#x201c;Good lord,&#x201d; the man said, shaking his head, &#x201c;how the hell can an itty-bitty dame like you drink so damn much?&#x201d;</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t all that itty-bitty, not really. If I&#x2019;d been standing, he would have seen that I was five-foot-three. But I was skinny. My body was as straight and sleek as my hair, which I wore bobbed to my chin with a thick row of bangs. Between my jet-black hair and dark eyes, made even darker thanks to my kohl eyeliner, I had that modern look, and it wasn&#x2019;t lost on men like the one sitting next to me.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious,&#x201d; said the man. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d a little lady like you learn to drink like that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My mother,&#x201d; I said, swirling my bourbon in my glass. &#x201c;She soaked my pacifiers in schnapps when I was a baby so I&#x2019;d fall asleep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll be damned.&#x201d; He knocked back his drink and fished a cigarette from the crumpled package peeking out of his breast pocket.</p><p>I finished that round with him, slid off my barstool and went looking for Evelyn. I was bushed and ready to go home. As I teetered across the wooden floor, I knew it was too late to rethink that second bourbon or the meager bowl of soup I&#x2019;d regarded as dinner. I perched my hand on the wall to keep the room from tilting.</p><p>The Five Star was packed, everyone sardined in, standing shoulder-to-shoulder. Couples filled the dance floor, doing the bunny hug and the Charleston while the South Side Jazzers played onstage. I went upstairs and found the second floor was just as crowded. Cigarette girls roamed the room in their short skirts and top hats, peddling trays of Lucky Strike cigarettes and White Owl cigars. Clouds of smoke floated above the blackjack tables manned by dealers dressed in red vests and matching bow ties.</p><p>Off in the corner, I spotted Evelyn by the slot machines, standing alongside a man with an unlit cigar jammed in his mouth. She&#x2019;d been end-of-the-week beat when we&#x2019;d arrived but not anymore. Each time the man pulled the one-armed bandit, she jumped up and down, her long brown spiral curls bouncing as she clapped, hoping the cherries lined up.</p><p>I accidentally bumped into a man at the craps table who had a floozy on either side of him. I apologized without really looking at him. It wasn&#x2019;t until after he threw the dice and his girls gave off an exaggerated round of <i>&#x201c;Awwwwwwws&#x201d; </i>that he got my attention. Tall, fit, and with his necktie askew and shirtsleeves rolled up, he had a slightly rumpled look about him that only truly handsome men could get away with.</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t win &#x2019;em all, can you?&#x201d; he said, giving me the once-over along with a mischievous grin, a kind of wonky, self-assured smirk no doubt prompted by the scores of innocent hopefuls who&#x2019;d preceded me. It was men like him who ruined it for the next guy who came along. And there&#x2019;d be the next one and probably one after that, because men like him were never anyone&#x2019;s last stop on the road to happily ever after.</p><p>I was exhausted and not about to give him the satisfaction of knowing he was as good-looking as he thought he was. &#x201c;Better luck next time,&#x201d; I said, and turned to walk away.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, not so fast, doll.&#x201d; He grabbed my hand, and it touched off a spark I wasn&#x2019;t expecting. &#x201c;I was winning until you showed up. What&#x2019;s your rush?&#x201d; He flashed that smile of his just as a few locks of hair fell forward onto his brow. Soft brown, the color of chestnuts. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t mind my saying&#x201d;&#x2014;he leaned in closer&#x2014;&#x201c;you&#x2019;re a beautiful-looking woman. You must be a model.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, c&#x2019;mon.&#x201d; I laughed and rolled my eyes. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you feed a girl a better line than that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, then how about an actress?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please&#x2014;do girls actually believe you when you say things like that?&#x201d; I crossed my arms, hoping to stop my urge to reach over and brush that lock of hair aside with my fingertips.</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let me buy you a drink. What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Vera.&#x201d; I looked over at Evelyn. She was still with that man at the slots, and there was no way she&#x2019;d be ready to go. She&#x2019;d no sooner leave his side than he&#x2019;d leave a hot machine.</p><p>Even though I&#x2019;d had those two bourbons already, I agreed to let him buy me a drink. He introduced himself as Tony Liolli and boy, I could tell right off he was some operator.</p><p>We had almost made it to the bar when a red light overhead flashed and an alarm sounded. I flinched, it gave me such a start.</p><p>Tony put his arm down like a crossing gate in front of me. &#x201c;Oh, goddammit!&#x201d; The alarm sounded again, longer this time.</p><p>&#x201c;What is that? What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d; I gripped his arm, sobering up fast, thinking the place was on fire. My heart was racing.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Raid!&#x201d;</i> someone shouted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the feds! Raid! Everybody clear out!&#x201d;</p><p>All at once people began hollering as they shoved past us, rushing toward the stairs. A dealer rammed into me, nearly knocking me over, while he and another barkeeper raced around, trying to get rid of any traces of liquor. I saw one of them pull a handle on the side of the bar and all the bottles on the shelves went <i>whoosh</i> and disappeared through a trapdoor. Two other men bolted past me, grabbed hold of the bar and flipped it upside down, making it look like an innocent hutch. Within seconds all the slot machines were spun around; their flip sides were disguised as bookcases.</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, we gotta get out of here.&#x201d; Tony grabbed my hand and weaved me through the crowd, heading for the doorway. The alarm blasted again and again while everybody charged toward the staircase, knocking tables and chairs out of the way. I trampled over someone&#x2019;s lost fedora and nearly tripped on an abandoned pocketbook.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; I turned around, my heart pumping like mad. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Evelyn? <i>Evelyn!</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who the hell&#x2019;s Evelyn?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Evelyn. My roommate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Forget Evelyn,&#x201d; Tony shouted back, &#x201c;unless you wanna see the inside of a paddy wagon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Evelyn? Evelyn!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon. Now!&#x201d;</p><p>After one last look for my friend, Tony and I were on the move, working our way toward the front, when the direction of the crowd suddenly reversed and people started backing up, rearing into one another. The feds were heading in, and everyone who&#x2019;d been trying to get down the stairs rushed back to the main room. A heavyset man wearing too much cologne stepped on my foot just as the agents burst inside with their whistles blowing shrill, high-pitched chirps.</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon,&#x201d; Tony said, pulling at me. &#x201c;Over here.&#x201d; He moved fast, yanking me toward the back of the room. When we dead-ended into a concrete wall, I froze. But Tony grabbed hold of a brass knob and turned it, and the wall slid to the right. It was just a facade concealing a rickety staircase. The dealers, barkeepers, waiters, and even the cigarette girls crowded in behind us.</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon&#x2014;hurry!&#x201d;</p><p>I took one last desperate look around for Evelyn. &#x201c;Evelyn? Evelyn!&#x201d; It was no use.</p><p>Tony herded me and a dozen others down the stairs. There was no railing and not much light until we made it to the first-floor landing. Tony and another man unlatched a second doorway that led to another flight of stairs. We heard screams and cries coming from the upper floors. It sounded like a stampede.</p><p>When we reached the basement, Tony guided us to a long, narrow tunnel littered with garbage, smashed beer and whiskey bottles. It smelled of urine, and God knows what else. I began to tremble. I couldn&#x2019;t see much, but I knew we must have somehow entered the sewer tunnel. Something scurried across the floor and I yelped, watching a long, skinny tail whip back and forth before disappearing into the shadows.</p><p>Tony hustled the cigarette girls and the other men toward the tunnel&#x2019;s opening and one by one they vanished into the darkness. It was my turn. &#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; he said when I hesitated. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m right behind you. Go!&#x201d;</p><p>It was freezing and though the air was stale and sour, I gasped for breath. The tunnel grew narrower, and something was dripping from above, landing in my hair and on my shoulders. I heard the sound of shoes sloshing through the water on the floor as the others made their way ahead of us. With each step, more filthy, icy water seeped in through my soles, soaking my toes.</p><p>Each time I asked Tony where we were, he said, &#x201c;Keep going. Don&#x2019;t stop, Vera! C&#x2019;mon!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay&#x2014;all right! I&#x2019;m going, I&#x2019;m going!&#x201d; My feet inched along in the darkness, my fingers grazing the dripping, crumbling tunnel walls. The water was up to my ankles now and I could barely feel my feet; my toes had long since gone numb. Deeper into the tunnel, the shadows began to fade, eventually vanishing until everything became the blackest of blacks. I couldn&#x2019;t see my hands in front of me. The wall was all I had, my only source of reference. I was surrounded by the sounds of sluicing water and rodents scratching and scurrying about. If Tony was still behind me, I had no sense of him. I was alone in that endless blackness, shuffling and groping my way forward.</p><p>When I thought I couldn&#x2019;t take one more step, I heard the purr of automobiles and the rumble of the streetcars overhead. Shadows of the others came into view as we worked our way toward another set of stairs. A haze of light flooded down and I raced ahead, splashing through the sewer water.</p><p>Once I made it to the top, Tony was right behind me. I couldn&#x2019;t believe where we were: We ended up on the sidewalk directly across the street from the Five Star. Paddy wagons were parked in front and federal agents were everywhere. I saw handcuffs on the man who&#x2019;d bought me the bourbons earlier. He was being loaded into a paddy wagon along with everyone else who hadn&#x2019;t made it out in time. I did another frantic search for Evelyn. <i>Oh, God, please don&#x2019;t let her be arrested.</i> What if the feds had her? How would I get her out of jail? It took money to do that and twelve dollars was all I had to my name. <i>Evelyn, where are you!</i></p><p>More people were hustled into the paddy wagons while others raced past us up and down the sidewalk, distancing themselves from the action.</p><p>Tony checked his pocket watch. &#x201c;Think you&#x2019;ll be all right now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re leaving?&#x201d; My voice went up an octave and I shivered. Goose bumps freckled my damp arms and legs. It was December, my feet were soaking and my coat was being held hostage inside the Five Star.</p><p>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t stick around much longer if I were you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you <i>are</i> leaving?&#x201d;</p><p>He leaned over and kissed my cheek. &#x201c;See ya &#x2019;round, Vera.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Sure. See you &#x2019;round.&#x201d; I stared at the tops of my waterlogged shoes. I was standing like a schoolgirl, pigeon-toed. I saw where the sewer water had washed away the seams I&#x2019;d drawn on the backs of my calves. When I looked up again, Tony had already disappeared around the corner.</p><p><i>Don&#x2019;t you dare cry. Do not!</i></p><p>Suddenly I spotted Evelyn halfway down the block, standing beneath a streetlight, hugging herself to keep warm. I began to breathe again. She searched up and down the street like a child lost at the fair, strands of her long brown curls blowing across her pale face.</p><p>&#x201c;Evelyn! Hey, Ev!&#x201d;</p><p>She saw me running toward her and raced in my direction. We collided, throwing our arms around each other, half laughing, half crying, both of us talking at once.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh my God.&#x201d; She clasped a hand over her heart. &#x201c;How did we end up in the middle of a raid?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe what just happened.&#x201d; I was so relieved, I hugged her again. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, let&#x2019;s get the hell out of here.&#x201d; I reached into my pocket for a dollar bill, waved it in the air and flagged down a taxicab.</p><p></p><p></p><p>DIAMONDS AND GEMS</p><p>A few weeks later, Evelyn sat on the side of my bed shaking me awake like she did most mornings. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, get up. It&#x2019;s ten after seven.&#x201d;</p><p>I groaned as I opened my eyes. It couldn&#x2019;t possibly be morning already.</p><p>I&#x2019;d recently taken a second job so I could make ends meet. One of the girls in the rooming house had told me about it. Said I could earn two dollars a night modeling jewelry for a man who worked fancy parties for Chicago&#x2019;s elite.</p><p>The two dollars I&#x2019;d been promised turned out to be a buck fifty, but I needed the money. That extra seven fifty or ten fifty a week, depending on if I worked every night&#x2014;especially during the holiday season&#x2014;meant I didn&#x2019;t have to choose between making my rent and going to bed hungry. Plus, I got to wear pretty dresses and real diamonds and pearls. Working those parties put me smack in the center of a lot of impressive, glamorous people and you never knew who you&#x2019;d meet. The day after a party I&#x2019;d always see the photographs all over the society pages. Once I even managed to get myself in a picture. I recognized the dress first and realized the shoulder and back of the head belonged to me. I clipped the photograph and tucked it up in the corner of my mirror. Someday, I told myself, I would be important enough to be the subject of a society page photograph.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t hear you come in,&#x201d; Evelyn said. &#x201c;Was it very late?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;After one.&#x201d; I yawned. &#x201c;I missed my train and had to wait forty minutes for the next one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Poor thing.&#x201d; Evelyn bent down and stroked my ...</p></p><h2>Savage Nature (A Leopard Novel)</h2><p><b>Danger lurks in the shadows and desire shimmers in the sultry heat in this novel of the Leopard people from #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Christine Feehan...<br><br></b>When Saria Boudreaux finds a dead body in the Louisiana bayou near her home, her first instinct is to go to the police.

Then she came to Bellevue. For nine eventful years, Dr. Holland was the weekend physician in charge of the psychiatric emergency room at New York City&#x2019;s Bellevue Hospital. In this absorbing memoir, Holland recounts stories from her vast case files that are alternately terrifying, tragically comic, and profoundly moving: the serial killer, the naked man barking like a dog in Times Square, the schizophrenic begging for an injection of club soda to quiet the voices in his head, the subway conductor who helplessly watched a young woman pushed into the path of his train. Writing with uncommon candor, Holland supplies not only a page-turner with all the fast-paced immediacy of a TV medical drama but also a fascinating glimpse into the inner lives of doctors who struggle to maintain perspective in a world where sanity is in the eye of the beholder. <br><br><b>Praise for <i>Weekends at Bellevue</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;An extraordinary insider&#x2019;s look at the typical days and nights of that most extraordinary place, written with a rare combination of toughness, tenderness, and outrageous humor.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Andrew Weil, M.D.&nbsp;</b><br><br>&#x201c;Unforgettable . . . tells a mean story.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>New York Daily News </i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The tension between [Holland&#x2019;s] macho swagger and her shame at the harsh way she occasionally treats patients gives this memoir extra intrigue.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Psychology Today </i><br></b><br>&#x201c;A fascinating portrait . . .

After working at New York City&#x2019;s Bellevue Hospital for nine years, as the psychiatrist in charge of admissions at the psych E.R. on Saturday and Sunday nights, I came away knowing this for sure. Over the years, I admitted heiresses and art dealers, altar boys and college students, homecoming queens, studio executives, bankers, lawyers, correction officers, and the list goes on. No matter who you are, what you do for a living, how much money you have in the bank, or how often you go to church, circumstances can transpire that will bring you to Bellevue. This is one of the hardest lessons for our patients to learn.<p></p> <p>My years at Bellevue taught me many things, life lessons I could never have hoped to receive elsewhere, but the main take-home message was this: cherish your sanity, for it can be lost in the blink of an eye. Sometimes I saw the same patients repeatedly, alcoholics and addicts who were hitting bottom in regular cycles, showing up when their funds ran out. Other times, however, I met patients with no psychiatric history, who ended up at Bellevue when a bad break-up led to a suicide attempt, or a shared cigarette at a bar led to a PCP-induced psychosis. There are so many ways in which a life can suddenly unravel, and many of my patients could specify just when that started to happen for them--whether it was joining the army, leaving home for college, or living through the death of their child. </p> <p>Many of the people I encountered at Bellevue tried strenuously to convince me that they did not belong there. Or vice versa. A big part of my job was learning how to separate the genuinely disturbed from the fakers (some people actually wanted to be admitted to Bellevue, if only for the promise of a clean bed and three meals a day), and to identify the people who had been misunderstood, misdiagnosed, who weren&#x2019;t mentally ill at all. After a few years of Bellevue experiences under my belt, I developed a sixth sense for what real crazy looked like, sounded like, and yes, smelled like. One night a young man was brought in to the E.R. because he was found on a street corner preaching to passersby to give up their worldly possessions. I knew enough to listen and wait, and not rush to judgment, even though it might have seemed a no-brainer to admit him. Once I was able to draw him out, I learned that he had taken psychedelic mushrooms and then spent time in a Chelsea art gallery known as COSM, which I myself had been to and knew to be an intense, inspirational and potentially overwhelming experience, something that might well unhinge a person on mind-altering drugs. I spoke with him gently as his trip slowly ebbed, helping him to navigate his re-entry in the city hospital where he had landed with no money or identification. He stayed in touch with me for months afterwards, grateful that I was there to protect him when he soared--however briefly--beyond the boundaries of normal behavior. </p> <p>There is a diaphanous membrane between sane and insane. It is the flimsiest of barriers, and because any one of us can break through at any time, it terrifies us, causing us to turn our backs on those who remind us of this painful reality. But spending so much time with people who marched out of the lockstep of sanity has made me less forgiving of the way the mentally ill are ostracized and shunned. We owe them something better. And we should remember that the barrier separating "them" from "us" is not nearly as secure as we might think.<i>--Julie Holland</i></p>Julie Holland, M.D., is a psychiatrist specializing in psychopharmacology.

Yet before DNA and the molecular revolution, Barbara McClintock's tireless analysis of corn led her to uncover some of the deepest, most intricate secrets of genetic organization.

At her recent death at age 90, she was widely acknowledged as one of the most significant figures in 20th-century science.</p><p>Evelyn Fox Keller's acclaimed biography, <i>A Feeling for the Organism</i>, gives us the full story of McClintock's pioneering&#x2015;although sometimes professionally difficult&#x2015;career in cytology and genetics.

Thirty years later, the simple truths sought by research scientists whose training was closer to physics than biology continued to prove elusive, and the discovery of transposons in bacteria marked the beginning of a revival of interest in her work. Keller&#39;s analysis of McClintock&#39;s difficulty in finding a place to work and her relations with other investigators is insightful and thought-provoking, not only about women in science, but about the role of dissent in the scientific community.<p>Evelyn Fox Keller is Professor of History and Philosophy in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society at M.I.T.</p></p><h2>Getting Ready to Negotiate: The Getting to Yes Workbook</h2><p>This companion volume to the negotiation classic <i>Getting to Yes</i> explores the negotiation process in depth and presents case studies, charts, and worksheets for blueprinting and personalized negotiating strategy.</p><p>Based on the philosophy and advice presented in Getting to Yes - be prepared, negotiate interests not positions, understand the other side&#39;s interests, and work together - this is the tool that will help each person design the negotiating strategy that is best for him or her in any given situation.

Will the British transfer power to the Indian National Congress, which claims to speak for all Indians? Or will a separate Muslim state&#x2015;Pakistan&#x2015;be carved out of India to be ruled by Muslims, as the Muslim League proposes? And what will happen to the vulnerable minorities&#x2015;such as the Sikhs and untouchables&#x2015;or the hundreds of princely states? As British authority wanes, tensions among Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs smolder and increasingly flare into violent riots that threaten to ignite all India. Towering above it all is the frail but formidable figure of Gandhi, whom some revere as an apostle of nonviolence and others regard as a conniving Hindu politician. Students struggle to reconcile religious identity with nation building&#x2015;perhaps the most intractable and important issue of the modern world.

Or both. Our lives are caught in a swirl of attachments, overwhelm, and endless mechanical "doing." As humans it is our nature to experience clarity and spaciousness all the time. The problem is we lose focus, get off balance, and forget how.<br><br>With inspiring lessons, humorous stories, and nourishing practices in slowing down, simplifying, and self-care, longtime space clearing expert, Stephanie Bennett Vogt, shows you how to clear your home, quiet the mind, and restore your spirit, in ways that feel good and last a lifetime.<br><br><i>Your Spacious Self </i>shows us that it's not our stuff, but holding on to it that creates a force field of "stuckness" that clouds our perceptions and paralyzes our lives. Clutter is not just the junk spilling out of the closet. It is any thing, or thought, that prevents us from experiencing our true nature and best life. Clearing is not a tedious exercise in throwing away, but a gentle journey of letting go - one small step, drawer, or moment at a time.<br><br>Included are daily tips and meditations, a weekly worksheet, and six sample meeting agendas designed for book groups and "clearing circle" support groups.</p><p>In 1996 I walked away from teaching at one of Boston's preeminent schools at the height of a twenty-year career. I was at the top of my game, and burned out. I didn't know what I loved anymore, or who I was.<br><br>By releasing a huge part of my personal and professional identity, I was able to get in touch with the things that made my heart sing (and cringe): my passions, my longings, my fears... <i>my clutter!</i> For the super-organized neatnik that I am, this last revelation came down like a sledge-hammer to my self-concept and world-view.<br><br>I needed to re-discover what I had long forgotten: that creating beautiful home spaces that feel good and nourish people has always been my greatest joy. Intrigued by the larger questions of how our living spaces reflect us, affect us, and support us, I discovered and pursued a more intuitive branch of <i>feng shui</i> (and little-known field at the time) called space clearing. That was over twenty years ago, and I've been evolving with it ever since.<br><br><b>Turns out I didn't need to go on a pilgrimage or meditate on a mountaintop to find myself. My home became my temple, my clutter was my teacher, and my journey of self-discovery began with clearing out a single drawer. </b>Years in the making, <i>Your Spacious Self</i> has taken as long to write as it took to decode and embrace my own slippery relationship with my stuff and stress, and discover why most well-intentioned clearing practices do not last. <br><br>I wanted to write a book that cuts through the noise and charms that part of the mind that is spinning out of control somewhere in "overwhelm La-La land"; a book that creates the tiniest peephole of quiet, yummy spaciousness that not only expands with our awareness, but can be felt - at the deepest level; a book that delivers a palpable experience of ease in one minute flat. <i>Your Spacious Self</i> is that book.<br><br>Whether you are a super-organized neatnik, a hopeless clutterbug, a nonstop multitasker, a cautious beginner, an experienced professional, or a curious bystander, welcome! This book is for you. Here's what you'll experience in <i>Your Spacious Self</i> that is different from most clearing modalities:<ul><li><b>Clutter is defined more broadly</b> as a result of imbalance, (mis)perception, stuck energy. This book identifies the myriad ways we humans hold on and create imbalance in our lives.</li><li><b>Clutter is not the problem</b>, it is <i>holding on to it</i> that creates a force-field of stuckness that clouds our perceptions and paralyzes our lives. It is not the clutter but how we <i>relate to it</i> that needs our attention and compassion. </li><li><b>Clearing is not linear.</b> Clearing in this book is not a finite task that you do when you have the time, energy, or willpower. It is an ongoing practice that promotes well being and letting go. It is a journey that balances "doing" with mindful "non-doing."</li><li><b>Clearing side-effects are normal.</b> Feeling overwhelmed (stuck, confused, congested...) when clearing out a closet, for example, is a normal and welcome byproduct of the journey. It is what happens naturally when you release stuck energy.

Mills Thornton, University of Michigan <br> <br>"This valuable first-hand account of the historic Montgomery Bus Boycott, written by an important, behind-the-scenes organizer, evokes the emotional intensity of the civil rights struggle.&nbsp; It ought to be required reading for all Americans who value their freedom and the contribution of black women to our history." <br>--Coretta Scott King <br> <br>"A sharply remembered addition to the literature on what has become an event of mythic proportions, and a sound primer for those interested in community organizing.&nbsp; The author is scrupulously honest, modest, and gives unsung heroes much deserved praise." <br>--Kirkus <br> <br>"This fascinating memoir provides new evidence on the origins and sustaining force of the Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-56)." <br>--Anthony O. Edmonds, Library Journal <br> <br>"There's no substitute for this intimate memoir; it provides an immediacy and graphic intensity never before available." <br>--Marge Frantz, San Jose Mercury News <br> <br>"This powerful memoir is a milestone in the history of that boycott and in the American Civil Rights Movement." <br>--American History Illustrated <br> <br>"This absorbing study may become a minor classic in the literature of the Montgomery bus boycott. . . . Garrow correctly states in his Foreword that this book is the most important participant-observer account of the Montgomery protest available to students and scholars of the black freedom movement. . . . This straightforward, sensitive memoir is must reading for students of the civil rights movement.&nbsp; It is a powerful commentary on how a woman and the group she led rose up to throw off an injustice thrust upon them.&nbsp; When Jo Ann Robinson and other Montgomery women decided no longer to play the role of contented black Southerners, they gave blacks everywhere renewed hope, and they helped to create a national leader who took them closer to the promised land." <br>&#x2014;Jimmie L. Franklin, The Alabama Review <br> <br>"In an absorbing, first-hand narrative, the dignified and unassuming Robinson focuses on the role of the Women's Political Council (WPC) and details the WPC's plans to engineer a boycott months before the heralded arrest of Rosa Parks. . . .&nbsp; The value of this primary source will endure long after many best-selling, secondary accounts of national politics during this period have disappeared." <br>&#x2014;Keith D. Miller and Elizabeth Vander Lei, Explorations in Sight and Sound <br>This fascinating memoir provides new evidence on the origins and sustaining force of the Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-56). Robinson (English, Alabama State Coll.), a founding member of the Women's Political Council (WPC) of Montgomery, shows clearly that the initial idea for boycotting buses in that city came from the WPC. Moreover, several black women, including the author, experienced and protested the agony of discrimination on city buses long before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. One only wishes that Robinson had spent more time recounting her life before and after the boycott and less on retelling the well-known story of the tribulations and ultimate success of Martin Luther King, Jr. Still, highly recommended.

Why are dreams so strange and why are they so hard to remember? Replacing dream mystique with modern dream science, J. Allan Hobson provides a new and increasingly complete picture of how dreaming is created by the brain. Focusing on dreaming to explain the mechanisms of sleep, this book explores how the new science of dreaming is affecting theories in psychoanalysis, and how it is helping our understanding of the causes of mental illness. <br><br>J. Allan Hobson investigates his own dreams to illustrate and explain some of the fascinating discoveries of modern sleep science, while challenging some of the traditionally accepted theories about the meaning of dreams. He reveals how dreaming maintains and develops the mind, why we go crazy in our dreams in order to avoid doing so when we are awake, and why sleep is not just good for health but essential for life.<br></p><p><br><strong>J. Allan Hobson</strong> is Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts. He was the recipient of the Distinguished Scientist Award of the Sleep Research Society in 1988.<br><br>His major research interests are the neurophysiological basis of the mind and behaviour; sleep and dreaming; and the history of neurology and psychiatry, with his most recent work focusing on the cognitive features and benefits of sleep.

Lewis&#x2019;s classic, <em>Mere Christianity</em>, is now available in a beautiful keepsake edition 60 years after its original publication. A timeless and thought-provoking spiritual work from the author of <em>The Chronicles of Narnia </em>and <em>The Screwtape Letters</em>&#x2014;one of the leading Christian writers and thinkers of our age&#x2014;this beautifully illustrated anniversary edition includes a new foreword and fascinating background information on the story behind the book, and remains fresh and relevant for the modern reader. <br></p><p>In 1943 Great Britain, when hope and the moral fabric of society were threatened by the relentless inhumanity of global war, an Oxford don was invited to give a series of radio lectures addressing the central issues of Christianity. Over half a century after the original lectures, the topic retains it urgency. Expanded into book form, <i>Mere Christianity</i> never flinches as it sets out a rational basis for Christianity and builds an edifice of compassionate morality atop this foundation. As Mr. Lewis clearly demonstrates, Christianity is not a religion of flitting angels and blind faith, but of free will, an innate sense of justice and the grace of God.<p>In 1941 England, when all hope was threatened by the inhumanity of war, C. S. Lewis was invited to give a series of radio lectures addressing the central issues of Christianity. More than half a century later, these talks continue to retain their poignancy. First heard as informal radio broadcasts on the BBC, the lectures were published as three books and subsequently combined as <em>Mere Christianity</em>. C. S. Lewis proves that "at the center of each there is something, or a Someone, who against all divergences of belief, all differences of temperament, all memories of mutual persecution, speaks with the same voice," rejecting the boundaries that divide Christianity's many denominations. This twentieth century masterpiece provides an unequaled opportunity for believers and nonbelievers alike to hear a powerful, rational case for the Christian faith.</p><p>With a new foreword by Lewis's stepson, Douglas Gresham, this illustrated gift edition evokes the historic time and place of the book's creation.</p></p><h2>The Handmade Quilt: A Complete Skill-Building Sampler (Landauer) 21 Blocks, 1 Heirloom-Quality Quilt; Discover the Joy &amp; Serenity of Slow Stitching, Hand Piecing, &amp; Hand Quilting (Scrap Your Stash)</h2><p><p><strong>Discover the joy and serenity of slow stitching!</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Comprehensive guide</strong> contains 21 different blocks to use up your stash</li> <li><strong>Heirloom-quality quilt project</strong> using all 21 blocks provides both a complete learning experience for new quilters and a stunning project for experienced stitchers</li> <li><strong>Skill-building techniques</strong> begin with the basics and progress to more intricate methods with each new block</li> <li><strong>Detailed how-to instructions</strong> and photographs take you through the process step-by-step</li> <li><strong>Inspiring gallery</strong> of block color options is included</li> </ul> <p>With one quilt made up of 21 block designs, master teacher Carolyn Forster takes you on a quilt making journey that begins with the basics and progresses in skill level with each new block.</p> <p>Start with simple blocks and easy methods, then move on to more intricate pieces and challenging skills as your confidence increases!

It was an unseasonably cold and wintry day, but suitably bleak considering the circumstances. The headline two weeks earlier that Nicholas Spencer, president and chief operating officer of Gen-stone had been killed in the crash of his private plane while flying to San Juan had been greeted with genuine and heartfelt grief. His company expected to receive the blessing of the Food and Drug Administration for a vaccine that would both eliminate the possibility of the growth of cancer cells and bring to a halt the progression of the disease in those already afflicted -- a preventive and a cure that he alone was responsible for bringing to the world. He named the company "Gen-stone," a reference to the Rosetta stone that had unveiled the language of ancient Egypt and allowed the appreciation of its remarkable culture.<br><br>The headline proclaiming Spencer's disappearance was followed in short order by the announcement from the chairman of the board of Gen-stone that there had been numerous setbacks in the experiments with the vaccine and that it could not be submitted to the FDA for approval in the foreseeable future. The announcement further said that tens of millions of dollars had been looted from the company, apparently by Nicholas Spencer.<br><br>I'm Marcia DeCarlo, better known as Carley, and even as I sat in the roped-off media section at the stockholders' meeting, observing the furious or stunned or tearful faces around me, I still had a sense of disbelief in what I was hearing. Apparently Nicholas Spencer, <i>Nick,</i> was a thief and a fraud. The miracle vaccine was nothing more than the offspring of his greedy imagination and consummate salesmanship. He had cheated all these people who had invested so much money in his company, often their life savings or total assets. Of course they hoped to make money, but many believed as well that their investment would help make the vaccine a reality. And not only had investors been hurt, but the theft had made worthless the retirement funds of Gen-stone's employees, over a thousand people. It simply didn't seem possible.<br><br>Since Nicholas Spencer's body had not washed ashore along with charred pieces of his doomed plane, half the people in the auditorium didn't believe he was dead. The other half would willingly have driven a stake through his heart if his remains had been discovered.<br><br>Charles Wallingford, the chairman of the board of Gen-stone, ashen-faced but with the natural elegance that is achieved by generations of breeding and privilege, struggled to bring the meeting to order. Other members of the board, their expressions somber, sat on the dais with him. To a man they were prominent figures in business and society. In the second row were people I recognized as executives from Gen-stone's accounting firm. Some of them had been interviewed from time to time in <i>Weekly Browser,</i> the syndicated Sunday supplement for which I write a financial column.<br><br>Sitting to the right of Wallingford, her face alabaster pale, her blond hair twisted into a French knot, and dressed in a black suit that I'm sure cost a fortune, was Lynn Hamilton Spencer. She is Nick's wife -- or widow -- and, coincidentally my stepsister whom I've met exactly three times and whom I confess I dislike. Let me explain. Two years ago my widowed mother married Lynn's widowed father, having met him in Boca Raton where they lived in neighboring condominiums.<br><br>At the dinner the evening before the wedding, I was as annoyed by Lynn Spencer's condescending attitude as I was charmed by Nicholas Spencer. I knew who he was, of course. The stories about him in <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> had been detailed. He was the son of a Connecticut family doctor, a general practitioner whose avocation was research biology. His father had a laboratory in his home, and from the time that Nick was a child, he spent most of his free time there, helping his dad with experiments. "Other kids had dogs," he had explained to interviewers. "I had pet mice. I didn't know it, but I was being tutored in microbiology by a genius." He had gone the business route, getting an MBA in business management with the plan of owning a medical supply operation someday. He started work at a small supply business and quickly rose to the top and became a partner. Then, as microbiology became the wave of the future, he began to realize that was the field he wanted to pursue. He began to reconstruct his father's notes and discovered that shortly before his sudden death his father had been on the verge of making a major breakthrough in cancer research. Using his medical supply company as a base, he set out to create a major research division.<br><br>Venture capital had helped him launch Gen-stone, and word of the cancer-inhibiting vaccine had made the company the hottest stock on Wall Street. Initially offered at $3 a share, the stock had risen as high as $160, and conditional on FDA approval, Garner Pharmaceutical contracted to pay $1 billion for the rights to distribute the new vaccine.<br><br>I knew that Nick Spencer's wife had died of cancer five years ago, that he had a ten-year-old son, and that he'd been married to Lynn, his second wife, for four years. But all the time I spent boning up on his background didn't help when I met him at that "family" dinner. I simply was not prepared for the absolutely magnetic quality of Nick Spencer's personality. He was one of those people who are gifted with both inherent personal charm and a genuinely brilliant mind. A little over six feet tall, with dark blond hair, intensely blue eyes, and a trim athletic body, he was physically very attractive. It was his ability to interact with people, however, that came through as his greatest asset. As my mother attempted to keep the conversational ball going with Lynn, I found myself telling Nick more about myself than I had ever revealed to anyone at a first meeting.<br><br>Within five minutes he knew my age, where I lived, my job, and where I grew up. <br><br>"Thirty-two," he said, smiling. "Eight years younger than I am."<br><br>Then I not only told him that I had been divorced after a brief marriage to a fellow MBA student at NYU, but even talked about the baby who lived only a few days because the hole in his heart was too big to close. This was so not like me. I never talk about the baby. It hurts too much. And yet it was easy to tell Nicholas Spencer about him.<br><br>"That's the sort of tragedy our research will prevent someday," he had said gently. "That's why I'll move heaven and earth to save people from the kind of heartbreak you've experienced, Carley."<br><br>My thoughts were quickly brought back to the present reality as Charles Wallingford hammered the gavel until there was silence -- an angry, sullen silence. "I am Charles Wallingford, the chairman of the board of Gen-stone," he said.<br><br>He was greeted with a deafening chorus of boos and catcalls.<br><br>I knew Wallingford was forty-eight or forty-nine years old, and I had seen him on the news the day after Spencer's plane crashed. He looked much older than that now. The strain of the last few weeks had added years to his appearance. No one could doubt that the man was suffering.<br><br>"I worked with Nicholas Spencer for the past eight years," he said. "I had just sold our family retail business, of which I was chairman, and I was looking for a chance to invest in a promising company. I met Nick Spencer, and he convinced me that the company he had just started would make startling breakthroughs in the development of new drugs. At his urging I invested almost all the proceeds from the sale of our family business and joined Gen-stone. So I am as devastated as you are by the fact that the vaccine is not ready to be submitted to the FDA for approval, but that does not mean if more funds become available, further research will not solve the problem -- "<br><br>Dozens of shouted questions interrupted him: "What about the money he stole?" "Why not admit that you and that whole bunch up there cheated us?"<br><br>Abruptly Lynn stood up and in a surprise gesture pulled the microphone from in front of Wallingford. "My husband died on his way to a business meeting to get more funding to keep the research alive. I am sure that the missing money can be explained -- "<br><br>One man came running up the aisle waving pages that looked as though they had been torn from magazines and newspapers. "The Spencers on their estate in Bedford," he shouted. "The Spencers hosting a charity ball. Nicholas Spencer smiling as he writes a check for 'New York's Neediest.'"<br><br>Security guards grabbed the man's arms as he reached the dais. "Where did you think that money was coming from, lady? I'll tell you where. <i>It came from our pockets!</i> I put a second mortgage on my house to invest in your lousy company. You wanna know why? Because my kid has cancer, and I believed your husband's promise about his vaccine."<br><br>The media section was in the first few rows. I was in an end seat and could have reached out and touched the man. He was a burly-looking guy of about thirty, dressed in a sweater and jeans. I watched as his face suddenly crumpled and he began to cry. "I won't even be able to keep my little girl in our house," he said. "I'll have to sell it now."<br><br>I looked up at Lynn and our eyes met. I knew it was impossible for her to see the contempt in my eyes, but all I could think was that the diamond on her finger was probably worth enough to pay off the second mortgage that was going to cost a dying child her home.<br><br>The meeting didn't last more than forty minutes, and most of it consisted of a series of agonized recitals from people who had lost everything by investing in Gen-stone. Many of them said they had been persuaded to buy the stock because a child or other family member had a disease that the vaccine might reverse.<br><br>As people streamed out, I took names, addresses, and phone numbers. Thanks to my column, a lot of them knew my name and were eager to talk to me about their financial loss as well. They asked whether or not I thought there was any chance of recouping some or all of their investment.<br><br>Lynn had left the meeting by a side door. I was glad. I had written her a note after Nick's plane crashed, letting her know I would attend a memorial service. There hadn't been one yet; they were waiting to see if his body would be recovered. Now, like almost everyone else, I wondered if Nick had actually been in the plane when it crashed or if he had rigged his disappearance.<br><br>I felt a hand on my arm. It was Sam Michaelson, a veteran reporter for <i>Wall Street Weekly</i> magazine. "Buy you a drink, Carley," he offered.<br><br>"Good God, I can use one."<br><br>We went down to the bar on the lobby floor and were directed to a table. It was four-thirty.<br><br>"I have a firm rule not to have vodka straight up before five o'clock," Sam told me, "but, as you're aware, somewhere in the world it <i>is</i> five o'clock."<br><br>I ordered a glass of Chianti. Usually by late April I'd have switched to chardonnay, my warm weather choice of vino, but feeling as emotionally chilled as I did after that meeting, I wanted something that would warm me up.<br><br>Sam gave the order, then abruptly asked, "So what do you think, Carley? Is that crook sunning himself in Brazil as we speak?"<br><br>I gave the only honest answer I could offer: "I don't know."<br><br>"I met Spencer once," Sam said. "I swear if he'd offered to sell me the Brooklyn Bridge, I'd have fallen for it. What a snake oil salesman. Did you ever meet him in the flesh?"<br><br>I pondered Sam's question for a moment, trying to decide what to say. The fact that Lynn Hamilton Spencer was my stepsister, making Nick Spencer my stepbrother-in-law, was something I never talked about. However, that fact did keep me from ever commenting publicly or privately on Gen-stone as an investment because I felt that might be considered a conflict of interest. Unfortunately, it did not keep me from buying $25,000 worth of Gen-stone stock because, as Nicholas Spencer had put it that evening at dinner, after this vaccine eliminated the possibility of cancer, there would someday be another to eliminate all genetic abnormalities.<br><br>My baby had been baptized the day he was born. I'd called him Patrick, giving him my maternal grandfather's name. I bought that stock as kind of a tribute to my son's memory. That night two years ago Nick had said that the more money they could raise, the faster they would have the tests on the vaccine completed and be able to make it available. "And, of course, eventually your twenty-five thousand dollars will be worth a great deal more," he had added.<br><br>That money had represented my savings toward a down payment on an apartment.<br><br>I looked at Sam and smiled, still debating my answer. Sam's hair is a kind of grizzled gray. His one vanity is to comb long strands of it over his balding dome. I've noticed that these strands often are somewhat askew, as they were now, and as an old pal I've had to resist saying, "Surrender. You've lost the hair battle."<br><br>Sam is pushing seventy, but his baby blue eyes are bright and alert. There's nothing babyish behind that pucklike face, however. He's smart and shrewd. I realized it wouldn't be fair not to tell him of my somewhat tenuous connection to the Spencers, but I would make it clear that I'd actually met Nick only once and Lynn three times.<br><br>I watched his eyebrows raise as I filled him in on the relationship.<br><br>"She comes through as a pretty cool customer to me," he said. "What about Spencer?"<br><br>"I would have bought the Brooklyn Bridge from him, too. I thought he was a terrific guy."<br><br>"What do you think now?"<br><br>"You mean, whether he's dead or somehow arranged the crash? I don't know."<br><br>"What about the wife, your stepsister?"<br><br>I know I winced. "Sam, my mother is genuinely happy with Lynn's father, or else she's putting on one hell of a performance. God help us, the two of them are even taking piano lessons together. You should have heard the concert I got treated to when I went down to Boca for a weekend last month. I admit I didn't like Lynn when I met her. I think she kisses the mirror every morning. But then, I only saw her the night before the wedding, at the wedding, and one other time when I arrived in Boca last year just as she was leaving. So do me a favor and don't refer to her as my stepsister."<br><br>"Noted."<br><br>The waitress came with our drinks. Sam sipped appreciatively and then cleared his throat. "Carley, I just heard that you applied for the job that's opening up at the magazine."<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"How come?"<br><br>"I want to write for a serious financial magazine, not just have a column that is essentially a financial filler in a general interest Sunday supplement. Reporting for <i>Wall Street Weekly</i> is my goal. How do you know I applied?"<br><br>"The big boss, Will Kirby, asked about you."<br><br>"What did you tell him?"<br><br>"I said you had brains and you'd be a big step up from the guy who's leaving."<br><br>Half an hour later Sam dropped me off in front of my place. I live in the second-floor apartment of a converted brownstone on East 37th Street in Manhattan. I ignored the elevator, which deserves to be ignored, and walked up the single flight. It was a relief to unlock my door and go inside. I was down in the dumps for very good reasons. The financial situation of those investors had gotten to me, but it was more than that. Many of them had made the investment for the same reason I had, because they wanted to stop the progress of an illness in someo...</p><h2>Curatorial Activism: Towards an Ethics of Curating</h2><p><p><strong>A handbook of new curatorial strategies based on pioneering examples of curators working to offset racial and gender disparities in the art world</strong></p><p>Current art world statistics demonstrate that the fight for gender and race equality in the art world is far from over: only sixteen percent of this year&#x2019;s Venice Biennale artists were female; only fourteen percent of the work displayed at MoMA in 2016 was by nonwhite artists; only a third of artists represented by U.S. galleries are female, but over two-thirds of students enrolled in art and art-history programs are young women.</p><p>Arranged in thematic sections focusing on feminism, race, and sexuality, <em>Curatorial Activism</em> examines and illustrates pioneering examples of exhibitions that have broken down boundaries and demonstrated that new approaches are possible, from Linda Nochlin&#x2019;s &#x201c;Women Artists&#x201d; at LACMA in the mid-1970s to Jean-Hubert Martin&#x2019;s &#x201c;Carambolages&#x201d; in 2016 at the Grand Palais in Paris.

Chest specialist Frederick Klenner, M.D., was curing multiple sclerosis and polio back in the 1940s, also using vitamins. William Kaufman, M.D., cured arthritis, also in the 1940s. In the 1950s, Drs. Wilfrid and Evan Shute were curing various forms of cardiovascular disease with a vitamin. At the same time, psychiatrist Abram Hoffer was using niacin to cure schizophrenia, psychosis, and depression. In the 1960s, Robert Cathcart, M.D., cured influenza, pneumonia, and hepatitis. In the 1970s, Hugh D. Riordan, M.D., was obtaining cures of cancer with intravenous vitamin C. Dr. Harold Foster and colleagues arrested and reversed full-blown AIDS with nutrient therapy, and in just the last few years, Atsuo Yanagasawa, M.D., Ph.D., has shown that vitamin therapy can prevent and reverse sickness caused by exposure to nuclear radiation. Since 1968, much of this research has been published in the <i>Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine.</i> This book brings forward important material selected from over forty-five years of JOM directly to the reader. <br> <br>At some <b>800 pages</b>, <i>The Orthomolecular Treatment of Chronic Disease</i> is a very large book, but it is also a very practical book.

It shows how this overlooked and misunderstood theory resolves the weirdness of Quantum Mechanics and the paradoxes of Relativity.</p><p>Rodney A. Brooks received a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University where he learned Quantum Field Theory from its prime developer, Julian Schwinger. During a 25 year career at the National Institutes of Health he published 124 refereed articles. Among his accomplishments was the design and construction of the highest resolution PET scanner at the time. As an amateur clarinetist he founded and led a klezmer band called Shir Delite. After retiring in 1999 he moved to New Zealand where he founded &#34;Kiwis for Balanced Reporting on the Middle East.&#34;I now realize that from all the popular books on physics that I have read or skimmed, and there have been many, I have learned nothing! But your book I remember very well, and not only that but I feel that I finally understand relativity intuitively, as much as I possibly can for a layman (and, in a way, perhaps better than many physicists). You really have something to say, and what you say sticks to the ribs when the book is gone. --Arthur Schwartz, M.D.<br><br>Although many books have been written about the interpretation of quantum physics, Rodney Brooks has written a book that finally gets it entirely right... Brooks presents the news about quantum field theory in a non-technical but accurate manner that will enlighten both the general public and the professional scientists. His explanatory technique of using different colors to represent different fields is a stroke of pedagogical genius. Anybody who wants to understand quantum physics should read this book. --Art Hobson, Ph.D., 2006 Milllikan Award winner and author of "Physics: Concepts and Connections"<br><br>Applying Quantum Field Theory [to wave-particle duality] is shown to cause the 'paradox' to disappear. Further, Brooks' attack on Special Relativity based on the behavior of fields presents the reader with a more easily understandable picture... Despite the fact that Dr. Brooks has essentially rejected the use of mathematics throughout, there is plenty here for specialist and interested reader to ponder. --Edward Finn, Ph.D., past Chairman of Physics at Georgetown University and co-author of the textbook "Physics"</p><h2>Corporate Finance</h2><p>ISBN: 9781260091878 is an International Student Edition of Corporate Finance 12th Edition by by Stephen A.

In centuries-old quads, croquet can still be played on lawns as smooth as velvet. Here, 'New' College's walls are actually over 500 years old, and Cotswold stone gleams in even the wateriest of winter sunlight. A city of bicycles, with undergraduates (and fellows) flapping about in faded, black gowns; the Martyrs&#x2019; Memorial, and fabled inns where the likes of J.R.R Tolkien sat and wrote about a Hobbit who lived in a hole in the ground. Everywhere you turn, you see history staring back at you. And of course there has always been murder! Edmund Crispin wrote his novels here, and it was here that Dorothy L. Sayers (who attended Somerville College) began to create her aristocratic sleuth, Lord Peter Wimsey. And of course, Oxford is the city of Morse.

The third edition differs from its predecessors in being substantially broader in scope and in the depth of evidence considered. The book is particularly distinctive in its critical appraisal of the challenges that lie ahead--for example, the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in young people&#x2019;s treatment responses, and the fact that most of the randomized controlled trials do not include multifaceted disorders. Although the issues concerned are quite tricky, the writing style is smooth and easy to follow. Anyone interested in the topic will both enjoy reading this book and learn a great deal from it."--Michael Rutter, MD, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, United Kingdom<br><br> &#x201c;Weisz and Kazdin--two of the field's most original and influential scholars--show how science can be leveraged with innovativeness and rigor to improve the lives of children and adolescents who suffer from psychological disorders. The contributors include many pioneers in developing and testing evidence-based psychotherapies, who write with great wisdom. Thirty-three chapters provide a perfect balance between the present status of the scientific evidence and clinical applications, and identify critical future directions for the field. A 'must-have' book for instructors, students, clinicians, and researchers."--Wendy K. Silverman, PhD, ABPP, Alfred A. Messer Professor of Child Psychiatry and Director, Anxiety and Mood Disorders Program, Child Study Center, Yale University School of Medicine<br><br> "The biggest question facing today's psychotherapists and psychotherapy researchers is how to personalize evidence-based psychotherapy using the available selection of treatment and monitoring tools. This holds true for child and adolescent as well as adult psychotherapy. I cannot imagine a better resource for tackling this task than this outstanding book. Comprehensive and fun to read, it helps move the practice of child and adolescent psychotherapy forward. As a text, it is a rich resource for courses on child and adolescent treatment."--Wolfgang Lutz, PhD, Department of Psychology, University of Trier, Germany<br><br> "Nobody understands evidence-based practices for children and adolescents--their development, evaluation, and implementation, as well as their strengths and limitations--with the depth and breadth of Weisz and Kazdin. The third edition has thorough coverage of almost all problems confronting clinicians and a very important section on implementing evidence-based interventions in a variety of clinical settings. Every clinician and clinical scientist will want this definitive resource on their bookshelves, and instructors will find it ideal for graduate courses covering psychological interventions."--David H.

A burgeoning number of books extol the scientifically proven benefits of meditation and mindfulness for everything ranging from business to romance. There are conferences, courses, and celebrities promoting the notion that Buddhism is spirituality for the rational;&nbsp;compatible with cutting-edge science;&nbsp;indeed,&nbsp;&#x201c;a science of the mind.&#x201d; In this provocative book, Evan Thompson argues that this representation of Buddhism is false.<br><br> In lucid and entertaining prose, Thompson dives deep into both Western and Buddhist philosophy to explain how the goals of science and religion are fundamentally different. Efforts to seek their unification are wrongheaded and promote mistaken ideas of both. He suggests cosmopolitanism instead, a worldview with deep roots in both Eastern and Western traditions. Smart, sympathetic, and intellectually ambitious, this book is a must-read for anyone interested in Buddhism&#x2019;s place in our world today.</p><p><b>Evan Thompson</b> is professor of philosophy at the University of British Columbia and a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

A deeply thoughtful book."&#x2014;Owen Flanagan, author of <i>The Geography of Morals</i><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;This book should be required reading for the increasingly large number of scientists and philosophers who are interested in understanding Buddhism&#x201d;&#x2014;Alison Gopnik<br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;This is a wise and thoughtful book.

The roll out of their well-tested battlefield weapons system known as 5G represents the pinnacle in their use of electro-magnetic frequencies to literally remote control what these feudalists have for 8,000 years seen as their human herd. Since their intervention in Sumeria, these hybrid fallen angel Nephilim have usurped, steered and plundered all of Creation as self-appointed god/kings. The coming 5G apocalypse represents an opportunity for a great unveiling &#x2013; the Greek meaning of &#x201c;apocalypse&#x201d; - of not only their nefarious 5G deception, but of the fraudulent Nephilim Crown itself. This book is written with the hope that it contributes to this great unveiling so that humanity will seize this moment not just to stop the 5G fourth industrial revolution of the Fourth Reich, but to emancipate itself from its Crown overlords.</p><p>My 6th book is a free fall to the depths of the rabbit hole.

All the familiar Portis elements are here: picaresque adventures, deadpan humor, an expert eye for detail and keen ear for the spoken word, and encounters with oddball characters both real and imagined. The collection encompasses the breadth of his fifty-year writing career, from his gripping reportage of the civil rights movement for the New York Herald Tribune to a comic short story about the demise of journalism in the 21st century. New to even the most ardent fan is his three-act play, <i>Delray's New Moon</i>, performed onstage in 1996 and published here for the first time. Whether this is your first encounter with the world of Portis or a long-awaited return to it, you'll agree with critic Ron Rosenbaum--whose essay appears here alongside tributes by other writers--that Portis "will come to be regarded as the author of classics on the order of a twentieth-century Mark Twain, a writer who captures the soul of America."PRAISE FOR CHARLES PORTIS<br>"Mr. Portis is a soft-spoken American genius and his work breathes pure decency. They ought to name a hotel after him, or at least a bus station." -Garrison Keillor<br> "Charles Portis is the goods: a deadpan reporter of human folly, a master of pathos, a compassionate portrayer of life's absolute absurdity, and a man with a voice." -Katherine A. Powers, <i>The Boston Globe</i><br> "No living Southern writer captures the spoken idioms of the South as artfully as Portis does." -Donna Tartt<br> "His fiction is the funniest I know, but the last thing in the world his characters have in mind is putting themselves across as comical. They are taking on the world in earnest. ... Lesser comic writers drag their characters onstage and say, 'Get a load of this guy!' Portis's characters just show up." -Roy Blount Jr.</p><h2>The Adventures of Polo: A Picture Book</h2><p><p>Equipped with a backpack full of supplies, Polo sets off on a little boat--and on a series of delightful adventures that take him across (and under) the ocean, to an island and a frozen iceberg, to space and home again, with a world of magical encounters along the way. Polo's journey is packed with incident and expression; 80 pages of seamless, satisfying picture storytelling are perfectly targeted to the youngest reader. Unique, dynamic, and playful, <i>The Adventures of Polo</i> calls to mind the worlds of film animation, comics, and classic books from <i>Harold and the Purple Crayon</i> to <i>The Snowman</i>--and has style, appeal, and substance all its very own.</p></p><p><p>Regis Faller studied at the Ecole des Arts Decoratifs in Strasbourg, France, and is the illustrator of over 20 books for children. He lives in Paris.</p>PreS-Gr. 2. Polo is a smart little dog who leaves his island tree house looking for adventure. His backpack bulges with supplies for every situation--his xylophone, which he uses to play in a monkey jazz band; the sticks and string he pulls out for a lava-side hot-dog roast. He sails through fog, rides a balloon, meets a snowman, and climbs a ladder to the moon, making new friends along the way. Although this may look like a picture book in terms of size, it's really a graphic novel. Faller uses sequential art to perfection in a charming, exceptionally clever, well-told story totally reliant on the art. The tale was originally published in France, but the story has universal appeal, and children will easily relate to the tales' strong sense of adventure and share Polo's curiosity about the wider world they don't yet know. Best of all, the wordless approach gives children space to add their own imaginative interpretations to the pictures. <i>Tina Coleman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This cult represents Masonic and Jewish bankers who finagled a monopoly over government credit which allows them to charge interest on funds they create out of nothing. Naturally they want to protect this prize by translating it into a political and cultural monopoly. This takes the form of a totalitarian world government dedicated to Lucifer, who represents their defiance of God. Thus, the people who hold our purse strings are conspiring against us. To distract and control us, they have used a vast occult network (Freemasonry) to infiltrate most organizations, especially government, intelligence agencies, education and the mass media. We are being re-engineered to serve the Illuminati. They undermine institutions like marriage and religion, and promote depravity, dysfunction, corruption and division. They have orchestrated two world wars and are planning a third. Henry Makow describes this conspiracy and shows how human history is unfolding according to Illuminati plan.</p><p>HIDDEN HISTORY, ZIONISM AND ANTI-SEMITISM<p> World events do not occur by accident. They are made to happen, whether it is to do with national issues or commerce; most of them are staged and managed by those who hold the purse string. (Denis Healey, former British Secretary of Defence.)</p><p> Political Zionism is an agency of Big Business. It is being used by Jewish and Christian financiers in this country and Great Britain, to make Jews believe that Palestine will be ruled by a descendant of King David who will ultimately rule the world. What delusion! It will lead to war between Arabs and Jews and eventually to war between Muslims and non-Muslims. That will be the turning point of history. (Henry H. Klein, "A Jew Warns Jews," 1947)</p><p> There have of old been Jews of two descriptions, so different as to be like two different races. There were Jews who saw God and proclaimed His law, and those who worshiped the golden calf and yearned for the flesh-pots of Egypt; there were Jews who followed Jesus and those who crucified Him... --Mme Z.A. Rogozin ("Russian Jews and Gentiles," 1881)</p>Henry Makow wrote a weekly advice-to-parents column for 50 newspapers when he was eleven; and invented the popular bordgame &#34;Scruples&#34; when he was 34.

Leslie A. Fiedler described the novel as "half melodramatic detective story, half bleak tragedy," noting that "morally, it is one of the most honest books in our literature." "Those Extraordinary Twins, the slapstick story that evolved into Pudd'nhead Wilson, provides a fascinating view of the author's process. <br>The text for this Modern Library Paperback Classic was set from the 1894 first American edition.&#x201c;Mark Twain, in his presentation of Negroes as human beings, stands head and shoulders above the other Southern writers of his times.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Langston Hughes</b></p><h2>Dreamer of the Day: Francis Parker Yockey &amp; The Postwar Fascist International</h2><p>Francis Parker Yockey, a lawyer and former war-crimes prosecutor, was one of the most enigmatic figures inside the far right in both Europe and America. While he is best known today for his book Imperium, a huge tome often described as a Mein Kampf for modern-day neo-Nazis, his life remains a mystery. Pursued by the U.S. Government for almost a decade, Yockey was arrested by the FBI in 1960. Shortly after his capture, he was found dead in his jail cell. An autopsy showed that the 43-year old mystery man had swallowed a cyanide capsule. Yockey&#x2019;s story takes us into the heart of the postwar Fascist International, a shadow Reich composed of spies, conspirators, and occultists.</p><p>"This study is a treasure chamber for all those interested in the ideology of the heirs of fascism and Nazism in Europe and America, of National bolshevism, Odinism, various occult sects of the extreme right, and the groups which tried to provide a synthesis between the extreme left wing and far-right thought" -- <i>Walter Laquer, author of THE BLACK HUNDRED: THE RISE OF THE EXTREME RIGHT IN RUSSIA, and FASCISM: PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE</i></p><h2>The New 8-Week Cholesterol Cure</h2><p><p>Robert Kowalski's personal story is legendary.

Image (Diamond, dist.), $14.99 trade paper (144p) ISBN 978-1-60706-563-0<br>The minute Nicolas Lash encounters Jo, femme fatale extraordinaire with more dark secrets than Faust, things go from bad to worse in this captivating noir. Occult forces and gut-wrenching horror collide in 1950s San Francisco, as a corrupt cop and a smitten reporter go toe-to-toe over Jo, an ageless beauty with the looks of a Vargas girl and the heart of a rattle snake, who is desperate to escape the grasp of a satanic cult and their demonic, shape-shifting leader. Graced with a suspenseful plot that has more twists and turns than an alpine road, and deliberately understated artwork, Fatale boasts both intrigue and an atmosphere that feels as densely bleak as a San Francisco mist at the tip of Fisherman's Wharf at dawn. Colorist Dave Stewart deserves special mention for his subtle, highly evocative use of neutral tones and earthy shades. This is a universe of darkness and gray shadows, and the palette perfectly fits the angst-ridden, desolate, catch-22 world of supernatural horror the protagonists must face-off against. Immortality may be a double-edged sword, but it's one the intoxicating Jo wields with a boundless grace in this addictive page-turner. (July) <br><br>The top-notch team of Brubaker and Phillips (known for their collaborations on Criminal and Sleeper) launch another series that gives familiar tropes an entertaining tweak. In present time, Nicolas Lash, executor of author Dominic Raines&#x2019; estate, discovers an unpublished manuscript mere moments before shotgun-toting bad guys pull up out front. Then Jo, a woman he met at the funeral, appears out of nowhere to rescue him. Jump back to San Francisco, 1956, and we&#x2019;re witnessing events from Raines&#x2019; book, starting with a young reporter trying to get a scoop from a beautiful woman about her corrupt-cop boyfriend. But any resemblance to standard detective fare ends there, as the creators mix in magic, cults, human sacrifice, and the possibility of eternal life to create a potent cocktail with any number of twists. Brubaker doesn&#x2019;t write a word more than necessary, and Phillips&#x2019; scenery has all the right angles, evoking a film-noir feel without slavish imitation. If the words &#x201c;last call&#x201d; make you think of &#x201c;The Call of Cthulu,&#x201d; this is your kind of hard-boiled tale. --Keir Graff</p><h2>The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: One-Volume Compact Edition: The Medieval Period through the Twenty-First Century</h2><p><p> In all six of its volumes <em>The Broadview Anthology of British Literature</em> presents British literature in a truly distinctive light.

In the inner room, the silent space in which God unloads the burdens and false selves that govern our individuality and our daily lives, God acts as a divine therapist, healing us and forcing us to recognize how many barriers we put up between ourselves and an authentic relationship with God. The process whereby this happens is the foundation of centering prayer&#x2015;a technique of prayer that Keating and other contemporary mystics have revived out of the ancient mystical traditions of the Desert Fathers and the medieval mystics. <br><br>Abbot Keating explores in this book what it means to enter the inner room and the transformation that takes place there.

Trump. The real estate developer from Queens promised to bring his brash, zero-sum swagger to bear to cut through America's most complex national security issues, and he did. If the cost of his "America First" agenda was bulldozing the edifice of foreign alliances that had been carefully tended by every president from Truman to Obama, then so be it.<br><br>It was clear from the first that Trump's inclinations were radically more blunt force than his predecessors'. When briefed by the Pentagon on Iran and the Strait of Hormuz, he exclaimed, "The next time Iran sends its boats into the Strait: blow them out of the water! Let's get Mad Dog on this." When told that the capital of South Korea, Seoul, was so close to the North Korean border that millions of people would likely die in the first hours of any all-out war, Trump had a bold response, "They have to move." The officials in the Oval Office weren't sure if he was joking. He raised his voice. "They have to move!"<br><br>Very quickly, it became clear to a number of people at the highest levels of government that their gravest mission was to protect America from Donald Trump. <i>Trump and His Generals</i> is Peter Bergen's riveting account of what happened when the unstoppable force of President Trump met the immovable object of America's national security establishment--the CIA, the State Department, and, above all, the Pentagon. If there is a real "deep state" in DC, it is not the FBI so much as the national security community, with its deep-rooted culture and hierarchy. The men Trump selected for his key national security positions, Jim Mattis, John Kelly, and H. R. McMaster, were products of that culture: Trump wanted generals, and he got them. Three years later, they would be gone, and the guardrails were off. <br><br>From Iraq and Afghanistan to Syria and Iran, from Russia and China to North Korea and Islamist terrorism, <i>Trump and His Generals</i> is a brilliant reckoning with an American ship of state navigating a roiling sea of threats without a well-functioning rudder. Lucid and gripping, it brings urgently needed clarity to issues that affect the fate of us all. But clarity, unfortunately, is not the same thing as reassurance.</p><p>Peter Bergen is a vice president at New America in Washington, DC, as well as national security analyst for CNN, where he writes a weekly online column.

Between 1966 and 1968, she published three novels to critical acclaim:&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Could Read Backwards, The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Turned On and Off</i>.&nbsp; In 1966,&nbsp;the<i> New York Times</i>&nbsp;labeled Braun, &#x201c;the new detective of the year.&#x201d; Then, for reasons unknown, the rising mystery author disappeared from the publishing scene. It wasn&#x2019;t until 1986 that Berkley Publishing Group reintroduced Braun to the public with the publication of an original paperback,&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Saw Red</i>. Within two years, Berkley released four new novels in paperback and reprinted the three mysteries from the sixties. Since then, G.P. Putnam&#x2019;s Sons has published seventeen additional novels in the Cat Who series. Braun passed away in 2011.<b>Chapter One</b><p> enter: kao k'o kung, howling </p><p> I'll never forget those days! I was getting my life back on track. I had a job, writing features for the <i>Daily Fluxion</i>. I had a place to live, an apartment on the ground floor of an old mansion. And soon I would be getting a roommate! </p><p> My landlord, who was art critic for the <i>Fluxion</i>, lived upstairs with his art treasures and a Siamese called Kao K'o Kung. Although I knew nothing about cats, I was enlisted for cat-sitting when the critic was out of town. </p><p> He wrote his reviews at home and never went near the news office. According to conventional wisdom, he never went near the art galleries either, but wrote his nasty criticism off the top of his head. Among local artists he was well hated, to coin a phrase. So no one was surprised when he was murdered in his own backyard. </p><p> That was the first time I heard the cat's "death howl," a bloodcurdling experience! </p><p> Kao K'o Kung-that smart cat!-then walked downstairs and moved in with me. I recall giving him some turkey from the Press Club that I had been saving for myself. </p><p> So here we were! Thrown together by fate! First thing I did, I changed his name to Koko. </p><p> He made no objection. He knew which side his bread was buttered on! In the days that followed we invented games to play, both athletic and intellectual. I was at work all day but made up for it by reading to him every evening-either the <i>Daily Fluxion</i> or the dictionary; he was not particular. </p><p> Then I began to find fault with the old mansion. It seemed to be the ancestral domain of a dynasty of moths, which were eating holes in my bathrobe and neckties. But where could I move? Apartments in my price range specified "no pets allowed." I discussed the problem with Koko, who listened thoughtfully. I told him that a friend of mine was going to Europe for three months and had suggested that I house-sit. Koko squeezed his eyes. We were getting to be pals. Then, to my surprise, he turned out be a self-appointed bodyguard and somewhat of a bloodhound! </p><p> One day he wanted to go upstairs to his old haunt. The murdered man's treasures had been removed, but I had a key to the apartment and the supply of cat litter. But that cat seemed to have his own urgent reason; he ran up and down the stairs ahead of me in anticipation. </p><p> Sure enough, there was a large tapestry still hanging in a hallway, and Koko was determined to paw his way behind it. When I went to his assistance, I discovered a door back there, which the landlord had found it advisable to conceal. It led downstairs to a small ground-floor apartment in the rear of the building, and it was filled with clues to the recent crime. It had been used as an artist's studio and still had an odor of turpentine. </p><p> Just as I was snooping around in amazement and Koko was getting some kind of early high from the paintbrushes, I heard a key turn in the rear door leading to the backyard, and a big man walked in. For a moment we were both frozen in surprise. Then he looked about wildly, grabbed a palette knife, and came at me! </p><p> Before I could find a chair to swing at him, Koko threw a catfit! The room seemed filled with snarling animals, attacking him from all sides with claws extended! I was able to clobber the guy, and we left him on the floor while we called the police. Koko spent the next few hours licking </p><p> his claws. </p><p> * * * </p><p> </p><p> I was glad to move into my friend's posh apartment on the fifteenth floor of the Villa Verandah. Koko seemed happy, too. I think he liked the view. Then one day I came home from work and found a large hole in the green wool upholstery of a fine wing chair. As I examined it, with horror, Koko jumped onto the chair seat and upchucked a green fur ball-still moist! </p><p> I immediately phoned the Press Club bartender, who always had the answer to all questions. </p><p> He listened and said wisely, "Sounds like an emotional problem. You need a psycatatrist. I can tell you where to find one." </p><p> It sounded like a hoax, especially since the address he gave me was on the edge of the red-light district. And I was even more suspicious when I phoned for an appointment and was told to come alone without the cat ... but I was desperate! I reported for the consultation. </p><p> It was a tawdry house, but there were cats on every windowsill, and that was promising. I was welcomed by a kindly woman in a faded housedress accompanied by at least a dozen cats who seemed quite well adjusted. She ushered me into the parlor and gave me a cup of tea with the inevitable cat hair floating in it. No matter. </p><p> What I learned, after stating the problem, was this: Siamese, when troubled, become wool eaters. My ties and bathrobe were undoubtedly wool. Koko was lonely because he was accustomed to having someone at home all day. He needed a nice little Siamese female for a companion. Neutering would make no difference. They would be quite sweet to each other.... I found this concept extremely interesting. </p><p> Now all I had to do was find a little female Siamese.... </p><p> Panic time! Here I was-a lifelong cat illiterate-involved in matchmaking between temperamental Siamese! I phoned the Press Club bartender for advice once more. </p><p> "Call the catteries listed in the Yellow Pages," he said with authority. "Check the classified ads in the paper. Call the pet hospitals!" </p><p> I did. My efforts turned up only one available candidate, and the asking price was more than my weekly paycheck at the <i>Fluxion</i>. I was just getting back on my feet financially. I needed to make a down payment on a used car. </p><p> Meanwhile I was afraid to leave Koko alone in the borrowed apartment; he might start eating the rugs! Once, as a test, I shut him up in the bathroom, and he howled so continuously and with such volume that there were five complaints to the manager. </p><p> Someone suggested selling Koko; it would solve the whole problem. </p><p> I considered that unthinkable. Already I felt a kinship with him that was hard to explain. </p><p> I'll never forget the frantic search for a companion who would stop Koko from eating wool! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Honoring the Medicine: The Essential Guide to Native American Healing</h2><p>For thousands of years, Native medicine was the <i>only</i> medicine on the North American continent.

It felt crisp and new and strange and exciting. Not like Earth, which he had visited once, where every molecule had cycled through countless generations of humanity, where the same old stories had played out endless times on land trod by untold numbers of people. Here, this spot, right there, had never before felt the weight of a person's foot. There, where trees with strange leaves and odd shapes marked where the grassland changed to forest, no person's eyes had ever before rested. Compared to this world, even the planets in the Alfar Star System felt like what they were now called, an Old Colony.<br><br> The sun overhead wasn't quite the right size for someone familiar with the sun that warmed the planets orbiting Alfar and looked a little too orange, but it was at the right distance from this world so that the heat it gave off allowed a person to walk about in shirtsleeves at this latitude and this time of the planet's year. The air had that fresh relish to it and could be breathed by humans. The green of the plants felt a little too blue, but that was all right.<br><br> A flock of small, birdlike creatures rose into the air with a thunder of wings and high-pitched, warbling cries. Like every habitable world that humanity had discovered so far, this one held an array of native life but nothing that could be considered sentient. If other intelligent species existed in the galaxy, they were still somewhere out there, beyond the current boundaries of human exploration.<br><br> Robert Geary knelt and touched the grass, grinning. Behind him, he could hear the rumble of machinery coming off the landing shuttles that had brought the devices down from orbit. Soon enough, those machines would begin constructing the first buildings of a city. Not an old city, with memories of generations of people and buildings, but also something new, not burdened with history but still awaiting history's first imprint.<br><br> A new world. A new beginning.<br><br> Unlike Alfar, the Old Colony he had come from. In human terms, a new place that had become Old in a few generations. Where "how we do things here" had fossilized rapidly into a society where no one was supposed to rock the boat because the rules set forth by the first colonists were the best and only imaginable ways to do things.<br><br> And if you could imagine other ways? If you wanted to try something different? Or, worse, change the way things were? Who do you think you are?<br><br> I think I am Robert Geary; therefore I am not going to put up with this when I can go somewhere new with other people who want to be able to breathe. Somewhere we can make our own rules.<br><br> "Rob Geary?"<br><br> The call from his comm unit jarred Rob from his reverie. He frowned at the worried tone of it. Why would the president of the colony's governing council be calling him? "Here. Is something wrong?"<br><br> "A ship arrived at the jump point from Scatha five hours ago. They sent a message as soon as they showed up, which we have now received."<br><br> "And?"<br><br> "They say this star system is under their 'protection,' and we owe them what they call residency and defense fees."<br><br> "That's ridiculous," Rob said. "I thought we were granted full ownership here by the Interstellar Rights Authority."<br><br> "We were, and we intend on telling them that. But what if they don't listen?"<br><br> "Why are you asking me? I'm not on the governing council."<br><br> "Because that new arrival is a warship. And the warship is heading toward this world."<br><br> He gazed upward, where the blue of the daylight sky drowned out sight of the countless stars. Somewhere up there was . . . what? A warship belonging to some other recent colony? A private corporation wanting to sell security services in a new part of space? A pirate, absurd as that seemed? "What does the council expect me to do about it?"<br><br> "We need advice, Rob. Advice from someone who knows something about this kind of thing. And in this colony, that's you."<br><br> Rob Geary touched the place on his collar where he had once worn the insignia of a junior officer in the small fleet of Alfar Star System. He had thought he had put that part of his life aside forever.<br><br> But maybe not. Whether whoever controlled that other ship called themselves pirates or privateers or security professionals or part of whatever fleet Scatha had, they were playing a very ancient game. It looked like humanity had brought some old, bad habits along with it to new stars and new worlds. And as someone who had chafed at not being able to make changes, to make a difference, Rob wasn't in a very good position to refuse to help when asked.<br><br> Fortunately, a shuttle had been about to lift back up into orbit to the ship, saving Rob time that could be valuable.<br><br> "What have we got?" Rob asked as he entered the command deck. The elderly passenger and bulk-cargo carrier Wingate, called the Wingnut by everyone, had been built to haul people and materials in a single star system, then had a new jump drive added on and instantly became an elderly interstellar transport. Aside from the up-to-the-minute jump control panel, the rest of the command deck was taken up by displays and controls that had been in service for decades-and showed it.<br><br> The main display flickered erratically until the Wingnut's captain, a woman apparently as old as the ship, slammed her fist against a control unit in a spot already dented by many similar blows. As the display steadied, Rob squinted at the information about the ship that was demanding protection money. "It's a Buccaneer Class cutter?"<br><br> "Yep," the captain said. "Not good for much in the Old Colonies but still handy where there's not much else to threaten them."<br><br> "You don't seem to be very worried," Rob told her, not bothering to hide his irritation at her attitude.<br><br> "You already paid me," the captain said, "and those guys from Scatha won't give me a hard time because I already paid them a license fee to operate in this region."<br><br> "License fee? You mean extortion?"<br><br> The captain spread her hands. "Call it what you want. Do you have a better idea? You going to fight that Bucket with your fists?"<br><br> Frustrated, Rob took another look at the display, then stormed off in search of the colony's governing council.<br><br> Half the council were already gathered, crammed into Wingnut's grandly named recreational room, which was just a compartment with several aging displays built in. The men and women of the rest of the council, still on the surface of the planet, could be seen on one of the displays. As Rob entered the compartment, a storm of argument dwindled as everyone looked at him. Council President Chisholm, looking unhappy, nodded at Rob. "Thank you for getting back up here quickly. What's your assessment?"<br><br> He didn't waste time asking why the leaders of the colony were calling on a lowly former lieutenant for his opinion. The Old Colonies tended to have really small military forces, which was why ex-junior officer Rob Geary was the most senior veteran among the initial group of roughly four thousand colonists settling this world.<br><br> "They have an old Buccaneer Class cutter," Rob told the council. "It arrived at the jump point from Scatha, about five light hours from this planet we're orbiting and colonizing. The information we have is still almost five hours light-delayed, but they were headed on an intercept for us at that time, and there's no reason to think they'd change vector. Their velocity is point zero five light speed, and they can't afford to push it any faster even if they had newer technology for their propulsion system. That means they'll get here in a little more than three and a half days."<br><br> "What can you tell us about the Buccaneer? How dangerous is it?"<br><br> Rob made an indecisive gesture with one hand. "Back home? Not very dangerous at all. The Buckets are nearly a century old, not very fast or maneuverable, and fairly small. They were built for law-enforcement duties like stopping smuggling and for search and rescue. All of the Old Colonies have retired and sold their Buckets, which is how a new colony like Scatha could get its hands on one for what was probably a cheap price. But in this star system, as the only ship equipped to fight, it's as dangerous as it needs to be. The sensors on the Wingnut are too badly maintained to tell us any details about the Bucket that showed up here, but it's probably got the standard weapons. That would be a single grapeshot launcher and a single pulse particle beam projector. Those are both close-in weapons. They'll have to be right on top of us to hit us, and their particle beam is probably early second-generation equipment, which means its hitting power is limited."<br><br> "But what can it do with those weapons?" Chisholm pressed.<br><br> Rob paused to think. "They could destroy our shuttles, preventing us from landing any more people or equipment, and stranding anyone up here in orbit. They could also decide to target this ship directly despite the owner's having paid them off earlier. Destroying the Wingnut would take a lot of work, but hitting critical areas like access hatches, air locks, and shuttle docking sites could cripple us."<br><br> "I kept saying we should invest in a warship of our own!" Council Member Kim complained.<br><br> "We didn't come out here to fight wars!" Chisholm snapped at Kim. "We went out to find the freedom and the room to follow our dreams! It's easy to say now what we should have done, but when all of us here decided where to put the money for this colony, we found that we couldn't afford even one warship like this Buccaneer cutter."<br><br> "We can't afford to lose any of our shuttles or pay this extortionate demand, either!" Kim tapped his comm pad furiously. "If we pay this, we'll barely be able to proceed with building the colony."<br><br> "According to the message from the warship, Scatha Star System says we need to be protected," another council member said. "Shouldn't we learn more before making a decision to reject their, um, offer?"<br><br> "They are not making an offer," Chisholm said. "Scatha is making a demand. That is not the action of someone seeking to help us."<br><br> "Do we know anything about Scatha?"<br><br> "All we know," Chisholm said, "is that the name they chose for their star system, Scatha, appears to be derived from that of an ancient warrior goddess. That and the fact that their first interaction with us is a demand that we pay them a very large sum."<br><br> "Appeal to Old Earth!" Council Member Odom urged. "When they hear-"<br><br> "They won't hear for months," Chisholm said. "And then what will they do? Old Earth has made it clear that while they love having their children spreading colonies among the stars, that love does not extend to actually helping them when they run into trouble."<br><br> "Old Earth got badly beaten up during the last Solar War," Kim grumbled. "They're still trying to rebuild. We can't expect them to help us. Which is why I wanted to buy our own protection!"<br><br> "Can't the police force do anything?" Council Member Odom asked plaintively.<br><br> "Twenty men and women with nonlethal weaponry?" Kim asked, his voice dripping with sarcasm.<br><br> "We have some weapons," Odom insisted.<br><br> "Hand weapons for hunting." Chisholm looked to Rob again. "What can we do?"<br><br> "I don't know," Rob said. "There are two other veterans among the current batch of colonists, and they're both former enlisted specialists from Alfar's fleet. They might know something about the Bucket that could help."<br><br> "You were an officer," Kim pointed out. "Surely you know more than any enlisted."<br><br> "Being an officer meant I knew enough about the systems on my ship to know how to best employ them," Rob said. "Most officers are generalists. The real equipment experts are the enlisted. I'll ask them. But regardless of what they tell me we can do, I need to know what we're willing to do."<br><br> Chisholm looked around, most of the other council members avoiding her gaze. "I know how criminals work," she told them all. "They'll take as much as they can, returning to hit us up repeatedly, while still leaving us enough to survive and generate more loot for them. We can't afford to give in to that. I need options beyond refusal and hoping they don't carry through on their threats," she finished, gazing at Rob once more.<br><br> "I'll see if we've got any," Rob told her.<br><br> Lyn "Ninja" Meltzer was still aboard the Wingnut, naturally enough. Also, naturally enough, she wasn't where the colony's individual locator software said she was on the ship even though that software was supposedly hack-proof. Rob punched her ID into his pad, hoping she would accept his call. "Ninja, where are you? We're dealing with a reality-bites situation."<br><br> Her reply came in moments later, showing her head against the top of her bunk. He had only met Ninja a few times, but she smiled in welcome at seeing him. "Hey, Lieutenant! Reality for real?"<br><br> "Yeah. Break time is over. Do you know anything about the old Buccaneer cutters?"<br><br> "I might."<br><br> "What about Torres? Do you think he's familiar with them?"<br><br> Meltzer grinned. "Corbin Torres served six years on a Bucket."<br><br> "How do you know that?" Rob asked.<br><br> "He's the only other fleet vet with this mob. Who else am I going to swap stories with?" Meltzer eyed Geary. "I heard there's another ship in-system. We're dealing with a Bucket?"<br><br> "Yes. Let's you and me and Torres get together and brainstorm this."<br><br> "Corbin isn't going to want to play."<br><br> Rob exhaled slowly. "Tell Corbin he either meets with me and you in the break room on the third deck in ten minutes, or the police will show up in fifteen minutes and drag him there."<br><br> "We're not being recalled, are we?" Meltzer asked. "Because I wouldn't like that, either."<br><br> "No one is being recalled. But the council, and all the other people with us, need you and me and Torres to figure out if there's anything we can do about that Bucket. If you and Torres want to go walkabout after we've hashed over the problem, I won't try to stop you."<br><br> Fourteen minutes later, as Rob was getting ready to call the council, Torres shuffled into the break room and sat down heavily in the seat next to Meltzer. In a colony group made up primarily of young people looking for a start in life and middle-aged people seeking a new start, Torres stood out for being older, his face bearing the lines of experience and the resentment of someone who thought life had not dealt out the rewards expected for a long life of work.</p><h2>Wonder Woman 2: Year One</h2><p>At last: the definitive origin story of Wonder Woman! <br><br>The island of Themiscyra is a paradise.

The book opens with Quarry being stalked in his Wisconsin home by two killers. They were ostensibly sent by someone who believes Quarry was responsible for the murder of the Broker, the middleman who gave Quarry his lethal assignments. After surviving the encounter, Quarry follows a lead to Davenport, Iowa, where his efforts to stay alive are complicated by an attractive woman who crosses his path. The story line is deceptively simple. As usual, Collins imbues even walk-on characters with personality. This reissue is a good entry point to the series for fans of gritty crime fiction, and showcases some of the prolific Collins&#39;s best work. Making a stone-cold killer sympathetic isn&#39;t easy, but Collins pulls it off. Agent: Dominick Abel, Dominick Abel Literary Agency.

He has become a martial arts icon, known not just as an undefeated dueler, but also as a master of battlefield strategy. Kenji Tokitsu turns a critical eye on Musashi's life and writings, separating fact from fiction, and giving a clear picture of the man behind the myth. <br><br>Musashi's best-known work, <i>The Book of Five Rings </i>, provides timeless insight into the nature of conflict. Tokitsu translates and provides extensive commentary on that popular work, as well as three other short texts on strategy that were written before it, and a longer, later work entitled "The Way to Be Followed Alone." Tokitsu is a thoughtful and informed guide, putting the historical and philosophical aspects of the text into context, and illuminating the etymological nuances of particular Japanese words and phrases. As a modern martial artist and a scholar, Tokitsu provides a view of Musashi's life and ideas that is accessible and relevant to today's readers and martial arts students.</p><p>Kenji Tokitsu was born in Japan and began studying martial arts when he was a child. He has taught karate in Paris since 1971. In 1984 he founded the Shaolin-mon school, where he teaches a synthesis of the original combat arts of Japan and China. In 2001 he established the Tokitsuryu Academy to teach and promote his method. For more information, visit www.tokitsu.com. Tokitsu also holds doctorates in sociology and in Japanese language and civilization. He is the author of numerous books."<i>Miyamoto Musashi </i> is a close look at the legendary swordsman and his treatises on swordsmanship and strategy by a Japanese martial artist.

The stated goal of this government program was to "kill the Indian to save the man." Half of the children did not survive the experience, and those who did were left permanently scarred. The resulting alcoholism, suicide, and the transmission of trauma to their own children has led to a social disintegration with results that can only be described as genocidal.</p><br><br><p>"The Indian residential schools in both the US and Canada... include[d] the forced exile of children and the prohibition of the use of a national language or religion....

He is currently a Professor of American Indian Studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder.</p></p><p>Ward Churchill has achieved an unparalleled reputation as a scholar-activist and analyst of indigenous issues. He is a Professor of American Indian Studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder, a leading member of AIM, and the author of numerous books, including A Little Matter of Genocide, Struggle for the Land, and Fantasies of the Master Race.This concise discussion is a continuum to Churchill's longer 1997 work, <i>A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and Denial in the Americas</i>. The author first analyzes the term <i>genocide</i> (coined by Raphael Lemkin in 1944), stressing that the phrase covers not only physical extermination of a people but also biological genocide (policies to prevent births within a group) and cultural genocide. The Indian residential schools in both the U.S and Canada fall squarely into this latter category, which includes the forced exile of children and the prohibition of the use of a national language or religion. Churchill next turns his attention to the schools themselves, uncovering a host of grim details. In Canada, half of the children sent to residential schools did not survive because of rampant disease, near-starvation diets, and brutal labor. In fact, Churchill observes that survivors display a level of dysfunction similar to that exhibited by concentration camp survivors. Churchill presents a bleak yet utterly necessary history of a brutal system that was in effect until 1990. <i>Rebecca Maksel</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

They set the standard by which we need to examine our ideas and beliefs regarding the subject at hand. Any disharmonious ideas or beliefs then need to be deprogrammed with Cosmic help. By doing so, we become free of the cause of our present misfortune. The I Ching makes the point that disharmonious ideas result in conflict, negative patterns of behavior, illness, and other fates. With every step we undertake to free ourselves from such ideas, we free ourselves from such misfortunes.The book contains� extensive commentaries on the 64 hexagrams� a method to clarify the meaning of the oracle&#39;s message in regard to your subject of inquiry� simple methods to deprogram the causes of fates, negative behaviors, and illnesses.</p><p>Carol K. Anthony and Hanna Moog.// Carol Anthony, b. 1930, began her study of the I Ching in 1971, during a mid-life crisis. The help that she received made her an avid student of the I Ching. After 7 years of keeping notes on her experiences with the oracle, she published these notes in 1979 under the title, &#39;A Guide to the I Ching.&#39; It was followed by &#39;The Philosophy of the I Ching&#39; in 1981, &#39;The Other Way,&#39; in 1990, and &#39;Love, An Inner Connection,&#39; in 1994.// Hanna Moog, b. 1946, has been a translator of English books on the I Ching into German, before she put out a collection of essays under the title &#39;Leben mit dem I Ging. Erfahrungen aus Kunst, Therapie, Beruf und Alltag.&#39;(&#39;Living with the I Ching. Experiences in the Arts, Therapy, and Professional and Everyday Life&#39;; Diederichs, 1996). She also contributed as a translator and commentator to the book &#39;I Ging, Das Orakel- und Weisheitsbuch Chinas (&#39;I Ching, The Oracle and Wisdom Book of China&#39;; Knaur, 1994). Ms. Moog, who has a master s degree in National Economics, and diplomas in French and English, came to the I Ching in 1982 during a personal crisis. Although she had no one to teach her the I Ching, she allowed it to speak to her feelings. &#39;I was deeply touched by its answers. I realized that no human being would have been able to characterize, as it did, my desperate situation so perfectly. At the same time, it gave me the deep certainty that there was something good in my life waiting to be discovered...something that meant growth, and a new kind of life; something that would truly fulfill me.&#39; Consulting the Richard Wilhelm translation of the I Ching daily, she felt that she often only got a glimpse of what it was saying, but she decided to keep her mind open so that a deeper understanding could take place through experience. Her dedication to the I Ching began to open more and more doors to being invited to speak and write about it. In 1985 she became a free lance editor for Eugen Diederichs Verlag, the publishing house that had first published the Wilhelm translation, specializing in editing books and translations on the I Ching, Asian philosophy, and mythology.// Carol Anthony and Hanna Moog began teaching and writing together in 1998. In 2000, they founded The I Ching Institute in Stow, Massachusetts, and have since then continued to give lectures and seminars in both the U.S. and Germany on the I Ching.The I Ching as a Book of Philosophy About the Cosmic Way <p>The entire I Ching is comprised of the answers of the oracle to human questions about what is in harmony with the Cosmos, and what is not. The answers were communicated to the recipients as a basic Yes to what was in harmony with the Cosmic Way, and a basic No to what was not in harmony with it. Thus the philosophy written within the I Ching developed from human thought about life as it was put to the test of the oracle. What emerged originally from this communication was a view of the Cosmos as a system of harmony which benefits everything that thinks and acts in accord with it, while reacting with Fate (adversity) to all that sets itself in opposition to that harmony. Being in harmony was expressed throughout the I Ching by the words "good fortune" and "success," whereas thinking and acting in ways that were discordant had the prognosis of "misfortune," or "remorse." </p><p>However, over the centuries, the oracle came to be overwritten, particularly by scholars of the Confucian school, who subjected it to what Joseph Campbell called "a forest of pencils."* Their overwriting added many contradictions to the I Ching text. These additions reflected the man-made order and the values of feudalism. </p><p>This new version of the I Ching is radically different from the traditional versions, in that the contradictions created by this overwriting, have been identified and separated from the oracle text. The manner in which this was done, was through consulting the Sage, using the rtcm, as to what the Cosmic meanings of the hexagrams were. The Sage has helped us to clearly identify the ideas and language of the feudal mindset that characterized ancient China, but which have also been carried over to most of today&#x2019;s cultures. This mindset differs sharply from the Cosmic view illustrated in the various hexagrams. The advantage for the reader who learns how to use the new method of communicating with the Sage, is that he can verify for himself whether the Cosmic view we have shown here, is correctly rendered. (See p. 736, Using the Retrospective-Three-Coin Method, or rtcm.) For our part, we have used this method to check nearly every line and word, as to whether we were communicating the Sage&#x2019;s message correctly. </p><p>This version of the I Ching, then, is the result of four years of asking thousands of questions. Our questioning followed one principle: were we understanding it correctly? When the answer was often No, we continued questioning until it responded that we had understood correctly. The answers corrected and enlarged the text. In regard to the two primary hexagrams, 1 and 2, it gave us a completely new understanding. It also explained why they, as written, contained misconceptions, and how these misconceptions had come about. It showed us how they are the very same misconceptions that are found in the major world philosophies, and to some extent, in the major world religions. </p><p>It removed from our own minds misunderstandings that have stood in the way of our finding, exploring, and developing the wonders of our own natures. Our impression grew that it wanted to liberate us, and humans generally, from the mindset of the "young fool," which reflects our training to be shepherded throughout life by human authorities, to help us grow up into fully responsible, fully realized beings. </p><p>Despite all our sincere intentions, the nature of communicating with the oracle is such that however many questions one asks, and however careful one is to clarify to the best of one&#x2019;s ability the answers, there remain always some key questions one has failed to ask: questions that are not yet within one&#x2019;s grasp. As we went along, we believe we became more skilled in asking these, but as the student of the Sage grows in his perspective, the questions he asks are always from this new platform of understanding. Important unasked questions will certainly occur to one or another reader. He now has in his grasp the same methods we have used, to ask his own questions. </p><p>Footnote: * "...all of the myths (or rather, as we now have them, moralizing anecdotes) of the Chinese golden age have to be recognized as the productions rather of a Confucian forest of pencils than of any &#x2018;good earth&#x2019; or &#x2018;forest primeval.&#x2019;" "Oriental Mythology: The Masks of God" by Joseph Campbell (New York, Viking Penguin, 1962), p. 380.</p></p><h2>Nothing&#39;s Bad Luck: The Lives of Warren Zevon</h2><p><b>Biography of legendary singer-songwriter Warren Zevon, </b><b>spanning his nomadic youth and early recording career to his substance abuse, final album, and posthumous Grammy Awards<br><br></b>As is the case with so many musicians, the life of Warren Zevon was blessed with talent and opportunity yet also beset by tragedy and setbacks.

Arguing that conceptions of Costa Rica as a happy anomaly downplay its rich heritage and diverse population, <i>The Costa Rica Reader</i> brings together texts and artwork that reveal the complexity of the country&#x2019;s past and present. It characterizes Costa Rica as a site of alternatives and possibilities that undermine stereotypes about the region&#x2019;s history and challenge the idea that current dilemmas facing Latin America are inevitable or insoluble.<p></p><p>This essential introduction to Costa Rica includes more than fifty texts related to the country&#x2019;s history, culture, politics, and natural environment. Most of these newspaper accounts, histories, petitions, memoirs, poems, and essays are written by Costa Ricans. Many appear here in English for the first time. The authors are men and women, young and old, scholars, farmers, workers, and activists. <i>The Costa Rica Reader</i> presents a panoply of voices: eloquent working-class raconteurs from San Jos�&#x2019;s poorest barrios, English-speaking Afro-Antilleans of the Lim�n province, Nicaraguan immigrants, factory workers, dissident members of the intelligentsia, and indigenous people struggling to preserve their culture. With more than forty images, the collection<i> </i>showcases sculptures, photographs, maps, cartoons, and fliers. From the time before the arrival of the Spanish, through the rise of the coffee plantations and the Civil War of 1948, up to participation in today&#x2019;s globalized world, Costa Rica&#x2019;s remarkable history comes alive. <i>The Costa Rica Reader</i> is a necessary resource for scholars, students, and travelers alike.</p></p><p><p>Steven Palmer is Assistant Professor of History at the University of Windsor in Ontario.

From 1935 to 1940 he assisted Dietrich Bonhoeffer at the preacher's seminary in Finkenwalde and, after the Gestapo closed the seminary, in the underground pastorates.

Many were crusaders for social justice and women's rights. All endured hardships, overcame obstacles, broke barriers, and changed the world. <br> The author ties the stories of these pioneer women to the experiences of women today with the hope that they will be inspired to live boldly and bravely and to fill their own lives with vision, faith, and fortitude.

The stories of 12 fascinating women will captivate you while exposing you to the history they did not teach us in school. The author purposefully chose 12 women of different nationalities, ethnic backgrounds, and socioeconomic status, to illustrate the diversity of the American West. Contrary to what our history textbooks and the Hollywood movies claim, white males were not even half the true story of the West much less the whole story. Monson wants to help correct that distortion. She hopes that by understanding the severe restrictions on women in the 19th century, modern women will understand how much we owe those who came before us, and understand what they were risking by pursuing their goals.'' --&lt; i&gt;-Coastal Breeze News, Florida<br><br>''Monson reimagines the campfire tall tale by introducing readers to overlooked talks of many forgotten heroines of the American West. Each biographical story defines perseverance, and there are inspiring examples of courage on each page as well as new lessons in how to live. Monson succinctly portrays a pioneering suffragette, a Sioux writer, and the most celebrated stagecoach driver in the West, who hid her gender most of her life. Another impressive pioneer is Clara Brown, a former slave who helped others make their ways from bondage to a better life in Colorado. Monson's accounts of these women who defied gender roles, who lived and breathed feminism, will resonate with all interested in the long-hidden chapters in American history. A compact, informative, briskly paced, emotionally rich, and eye-opening set of micro-biographies that will change truncated views of the West.'' - --Booklist</p></p><h2>Reading Power 2 Student Book</h2><p><p> <b> <i>Reading Power 2</i> </b> is a new and updated edition of the successful student-centered reading skills textbook <i>Reading Power</i>.

His March to the Sea, which resulted in a devastated swath of the South from Atlanta to Savannah, cemented his place in history as the pioneer of total war. <br><br>In <em>The Scourge of War</em>, preeminent military historian Brian Holden Reid offers a deeply researched life and times account of Sherman. By examining his childhood and education, his business ventures in California, his antebellum leadership of a military college in Louisiana, and numerous career false starts, Holden Reid shows how unlikely his exceptional Civil War career would seem. He also demonstrates how crucial his family was to his professional path, particularly his wife's intervention during the war. He analyzes Sherman's development as a battlefield commander and especially his crucial friendships with Henry W. Halleck and Ulysses S. Grant. In doing so, he details how Sherman overcame both his weaknesses as a leader and severe depression to mature as a military strategist. Central chapters narrate closely Sherman's battlefield career and the gradual lifting of his pessimism that the Union would be defeated. After the war, Sherman became a popular figure in the North and the founder of the school for officers at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, known as the "intellectual center of the army." Holden Reid argues that Sherman was not hostile to the South throughout his life and only in later years gained a reputation as a villain who practiced barbaric destruction, particularly as the neo-Confederate Lost Cause grew and he published one of the first personal accounts of the war.<br><br>A definitive biography of a preeminent military figure by a renowned military historian, <em>The Scourge of War</em> is a masterful account of Sherman' life that fully recognizes his intellect, strategy, and actions during the Civil War.<br></p><p><br><strong>Brian Holden Reid</strong> is Professor of American History and Military Institutions at King's College London.

Now, the world's most famous horse gentler demonstrates how his revolutionary Join-Up technique can be used not just for horses, but as a model for how to strengthen human relationships.<br><br>With vivid, often deeply moving anecdotes, Roberts shows how the lessons learned from the thousands of horses he has known can provide effective guidelines for improving the quality of our communication with one another&#x2014;from learning to "read" each other effectively, to creative fear-free environments, and, most importantly, teaching belief in the power of gentleness and trust.</p><p>Monty Roberts has changed forever the way we treat horses. This book may change the way we treat each other. <br> <br>Drawing on the experiences and wisdom gained over the decades in his groundbreaking work with animals, Monty Roberts applies that knowledge to the way we relate to each other: how we handle hierarchical power struggles, manage corporations and work with our colleagues, behave towards each other in our families, and raise our children. Rich in anecdote and by turns practical, philosophical and provocative, this landmark book bids us to rethink the way we use power over others, and makes the compelling argument that with humans, as with horses, the gentle way is the <br>better way."I'm no horseman, but I know miracles when they happen. I've watched this magician of non-violence change wild rearing beasts into gentle horses under their riders, time and again, in minutes. Here he translates from his original cross-species adventures to hand us some powerful lessons about healing and gentling ourselves and our relationships."

In <b>Awakening the Mind</b>, Anna Wise reveals how a careful understanding of the four types of brain waves, and the practice of carefully designed meditation exercises that lead to a mastery of each type, can vastly improve everyday focus, memory, concentration, and overall mental awareness. <p>Over the past three decades, Wise has measured the brain-wave patterns of spiritual teachers, artists, high-performing businessmen, athletes, and other highly creative and productive individuals. She discovered that, during periods of peak mental awareness and clarity, they all exhibited a specific brain-wave pattern in which the four categories of brain waves<b>&#x2014;</b>alpha, beta, theta, and delta<b>&#x2014;</b>combined in a distinct configuration. In this book, Wise provides meditation exercises specially developed to lead readers to achieve that heightened mental state referred to as the Awakened Mind. </p></p><p>Anna Wise, author of <b>The High-Performance Mind</b>, has taught meditation and brain-wave development for three decades. She leads workshops, seminars, and corporate-training programs worldwide. In 1988, she founded The Anna Wise Center in Larkspur, California.Like Wise's more technical The High-Performance Mind: Mastering Brainwaves for Insight, Healing, and Creativity, this work aims to help readers improve their mental powers by optimizing brain-wave patterns. A meditation and brain-wave development teacher, Wise writes lucidly about the four types of brain-wave patterns, or EEGs, giving readers "subjective landmarks" to help them gauge their own patterns without an EEG biofeedback machine. Expanding on the work of C. Maxwell Cade, who developed the biofeedback machine, she offers an analysis of the brain waves of successful people including Chi Kung masters, healers, artists, and CEOs that helps bring scientific measurement and clarity to the subjective processes of creativity and enlightenment. Unfortunately, her overuse of such corporate trainer jargon as mastery and power can become tedious. And though this work is more accessible than her previous title, it doesn't really offer anything new. It is an adequate addition to self-help collections, particularly those lacking her first book, but Jim Robbins's A Symphony of the Brain: The Evolution of the New Brain Wave Biofeedback offers more historical background and clinical application of EEG biofeedback.

It reviles her doctrines, mocks her moral teachings and invents lies about her history. In every age, but especially in our modern day, historians and political powers have distorted the facts about her past (or just made up novel falsehoods from scratch) to make the Church, and the civilization it fostered, seem corrupt, backward, or simply evil.<br><br> In Seven Lies about Catholic History, Diane Moczar (Islam at the Gates) tackles the most infamous and prevalent historical myths about the Church popular legends that you encounter everywhere from textbooks to T.V. and reveals the real truth about them. She explains how they got started and why they're still around, and best of all, she gives you the facts and the arguments you need to set the record straight about The Inquisition: how it was not a bloodthirsty institution but a merciful (and necessary) one, Galileo's trial: why moderns invented a myth around it to make science appear incompatible with the Catholic faith (it's not), The Reformation: why the 16th-century Church was not totally corrupt (as even some Catholics wrongly believe), and how the reformers made things worse for everybody and other lies that the world uses to attack and discredit the Faith.<br><br> Written in a brisk style that's fun and easy to read, Seven Lies about Catholic History provides the lessons that every Catholic needs in order to defend and explain not just apologize for the Church's rich and complex history.</p><p>Diane Moczar, Ph.D., serves as an adjunct professor of history at Northern Virginia Community College.

Packed with stories, biographical essays, scores of archival photographs and other evocative artifacts, it is an important contribution to sports history and a wonderful tribute to the players and teams who wrote a unique chapter in the annals of baseball and American culture.<br>National Geographic is proud to present this compelling volume, compiled by a who's who of authorities on the subject. Drawing on years of research, <i>Shades of Glory</i> traces the history of black baseball from the 19th century to the first great teams, such as the Cuban Giants, and on to the era of the vibrant barnstorming teams from the East Coast, Chicago, and Cuba. The unparalleled Rube Foster started the first Negro League in 1920, with such dominant teams as the Chicago American Giants and the Kansas City Monarchs. Pittsburgh soon produced two of the greatest teams of all time, the Homestead Grays and the Pittsburgh Crawfords, featuring such stars as Satchel Paige, John Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, and many more. Their superb brand of baseball rivaled the best of the major leagues until the historic signing of Jackie Robinson by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. <i>Shades of Glory</i> chronicles a bygone era of black baseball and the stars who were shadowed by racial prejudice, but now shine forth in all their sparkling brilliance.</p><p>Lawrence D. Hogan is a senior professor of history at Union County College in New Jersey. He is an expert on the history of black baseball and his touring exhibit on the subject has traveled nationwide. <br><br>Jules Tygiel, a history professor at San Francisco State University, is the author of <i>Baseball's Great Experiment: Jackie Robinson and His Legacy,</i> and <i>Past Time: Baseball as History,</i> a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year. <br><br>The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum was founded in 1939 and has become an American institution. Dedicated to chronicling and preserving baseball history and honoring the sport's foremost figures, it annually attracts more than 350,000 visitors to its home in Cooperstown, New York.*Starred Review* Histories of baseball's Negro Leagues abound, beginning with Robert Peterson's 1970 classic, <i>Only the Ball Was White, </i>but few offer the scope of this volume, which explores the entire spectrum of African American baseball. In July 2000, major-league baseball granted $250,000 to the Hall of Fame for a comprehensive history of African American involvement in the game from 1860 to 1960. The result, a cooperative work by teams of historians and baseball experts, was an 800-page manuscript entitled <i>Out of the Shadows.</i> This book is a distillation of that work. Hogan himself was a part of the research team and is an expert on the Negro Leagues. There are a number of player profiles and photos from the 1920s, '30s, and '40s as well as an examination of the entrepreneurial business climate that kept the leagues going even as it exploited the players. It's interesting to note that, of the hundreds of all-star games played in the off-season between teams of the top black players versus the best of the major leagues', the black teams won more than 60 percent of the time. Along with on-the-field reportage, Hogan also provides valuable historical context, placing the Negro Leagues in the socioeconomic fabric of the time. This is an important, informative, and entertaining contribution to sports history. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The foundations of the modern world were laid in Alexandria of Egypt at the turn of the first millennium. In this compulsively readable narrative, Justin Pollard and Howard Reid bring one of history&#39;s most fascinating and prolific cities to life, creating a treasure trove of our intellectual and cultural origins. Famous for its lighthouse, its library-the greatest in antiquity-and its fertile intellectual and spiritual life--it was here that Christianity and Islam came to prominence as world religions--Alexandria now takes its rightful place alongside Greece and Rome as a titan of the ancient world. Sparkling with fresh insights on science, philosophy, culture, and invention, this is an irresistible, eye- opening delight.</p><p>Justin Pollard, a freelance writer and producer specializing in historical documentaries, has written for PBS and A&amp;E. He is currently providing script and historical consultancy for Sam Mendes&#x2019;s upcoming feature film, <i>Tom Fool</i>.<br><p>Howard Reid has made award-winning documentaries for National Geographic, the BBC, and Channel 4, including <i>The Story of English</i>. He is the author of five books.</p>Ancient Alexandria was first and foremost a Greek city. Its history, however, is framed by two religious events that were alien to Greek intellectual traditions: Ptolemy's creation of the cult of Serapis, which helped him establish rule, and the Christian riots that massacred the pagan philosopher Hypatia in A.D. 415. Between these two events is an unmatched record of intellectual achievement, elegantly chronicled by documentary makers Pollard and Reid. Among the many scientific advances they cover, from Euclid and Archimedes to Claudius Ptolemy, perhaps the most illustrative of the city's cosmopolitanism is human anatomy, the Greeks' limited understanding of which was tremendously aided by contact with Egyptian mummification. Throughout, the authors are eager, at times overly eager, to demonstrate ancient Alexandria's modernity. So it is curious that little is said about the famous feud between Callimachus, poet and cataloguer of the great library, and his former pupil Apollonius. The ingredients of the feud&#x2014;plagiarism, obscenity, professional envy&#x2014;are strangely contemporary. The authors also paint an incomplete picture of the city's literary culture and its museum, which functioned like a modern university. These criticisms aside, most readers, especially those interested in the history of science, will find this a nourishing account. <i>(Oct. 23)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ironically, it will also weaken the language of grace, since the full impact of forgiveness cannot be felt apart from the full impact of what has been forgiven.&#x201d;<br><br>Contrary to the prevailing view, Taylor calls sin &#x201c;a helpful, hopeful word.&#x201d; Naming our sins, she contends, enables us to move from &#x201c;guilt to grace.&#x201d; In recovering this &#x201c;lost language of salvation&#x201d; in our worship and in the fabric of our individual lives, we have an opportunity to &#x201c;take part in the divine work of redemption.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Barbara Brown Taylor</b> is an Episcopal priest. She holds the Harry R. Butman Chair in Religion and Philosophy at Piedmont College in northeastern Georgia and serves as adjunct professor of Christian spirituality at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur. Recognized as one of the twelve most effective preachers in the English language by Baylor University in 1995, Taylor has published numerous collections of her sermons and theological reflections, including <i>Mixed Blessings, The Preaching Life, The Luminous Web, The Preaching Life, Bread of Angels</i>, and <i>Gospel Medicine</i>.'In the age just past, nationalism has brought us Hitler, science has brought us the atom bomb, and religion has brought us some really awful television programming.' So quips the inimitable Barbara Brown Taylor in a new book on a topic most of us think we've heard quite enough about already: sin.In the age just past, Brown Taylor gave us a half dozen of the best sermon collections any of us have ever read. I, for one, think of her as Barbara Emerson Fosdick, and seldom preach any gospel lesson without first consulting her. . . . She has given us a wonderful reflection on science as it related to religion (<i>The Luminous Web</i>) and now this slim volume on transgression: <i>Speaking of Sin</i>.But who needs it? All of us, especially lectionary preachers who are called upon, from time to time, to reflect honestly about a tricky subject to which our Bible is replete with references. . . . Those who look into Brown Taylor's books of sermons with an appreciation for her poetry will not be disappointed. Her section on sin in &#x2018;Genesis,' ch. 2, is alone worth the price of the book. . . . The book is an insightful delight. There is plenty here for the preacher to glean from and any Christian concerned in the least about ethics to be instructed by. To buy such a book and not to read it would be&#x2015;well&#x2015;a sin. (Scott Dalgarno <i>The Presbyterian Outlook</i>)<br><br>In this provocative book, Taylor offers a substantive argument that some of the great words of our religious tradition cannot be replaced. There are no substitutes for them, and when we try to talk around them, we find our speech diminished. Rather than ignoring or sanitizing such words we need to go diving for the core experiences these words describe. When we do that, we may just discover that an unpopular term like 'sin' may turn out to be the very one we need to reclaim. (Rev. Dr. Wayne A. Holst, the University of Calgary <i>Western Catholic Reporter</i>)<br><br>Barbara Brown Taylor, noted author, teacher, preacher and priest of the Episcopal Church, has a gift for writing simply and profoundly. In this book she brings those gifts to bear on a subject that unfortunately receives very little balanced treatment from either the study or the pulpit. She argues convincingly that many preachers have adopted, and their listeners accepted with ease, either the &#x2018;legal' or the &#x2018;medical' model of sin. In so doing, the real intent of Holy Scripture has been impoverished and its more hopeful and life-giving message of pardon and repentance ignored. . . . I highly recommend this slim yet deep volume for any Christian concerned with amendment of life. (Rev. Carlton F. Kelley, priest-in-charge of St. Paul&#x2019;s Church)</p><h2>A Theology of John&#39;s Gospel and Letters: The Word, the Christ, the Son of God (Biblical Theology of the New Testament Series)</h2><p>A Theology of John&#x2019;s Gospel and Letters introduces the first volume in the BTNT series. Building on many years of research and study in Johannine literature, Andreas K�stenberger not only furnishes an exhaustive theology of John&#x2019;s Gospel and letters, but also provides a detailed study of major themes and relates them to the Synoptic Gospels and other New Testament books. Readers will gain an in-depth and holistic grasp of Johannine theology in the larger context of the Bible.D. A. Carson (Trinity Evangelical Divinity School) says about K�stenberger&#x2019;s volume that &#x201c;for the comprehensiveness of its coverage in the field of Johannine theology (Gospel and Letters), there is nothing to compare to this work.&#x201d;I. Howard Marshall (University of Aberdeen) writes, &#x201c;This book is a &#x2018;first&#x2019; in many ways: the first volume that sets the pattern for the quality and style of the new Biblical Theology of the New Testament series published by Zondervan; the first major volume to be devoted specifically to the theology of John&#x2019;s Gospel and Letters at a high academic level; and the first volume to do so on the basis that here we have an interpretation of John&#x2019;s theology composed by an eyewitness of the life and passion of Jesus.&#x201d;The Biblical Theology of the New Testament SeriesThe Biblical Theology of the New Testament (BTNT) series provides upper college and seminary-level textbooks for students of New Testament theology, interpretation, and exegesis. Pastors and discerning theology readers alike will also benefit from this series. Written at the highest level of academic excellence by recognized experts in the field, the BTNT series not only offers a comprehensive exploration of the theology of every book of the New Testament, including introductory issues and major themes, but also shows how each book relates to the broad picture of New Testament theology.</p><p><p>Andreas K�stenberger is Research Professor of New Testament and Biblical Theology and Director of the Center for Biblical Studies at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.&nbsp;He is the author of numerous works on John, including his commentary in the Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament series, "John" in Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament, and &#x201c;John&#x201d; in Zondervan Illustrated Bible Backgrounds Commentary.</p></p><h2>The Art Lesson</h2><p>Tommy knows he wants to be an artist when he grows up. He can't wait to get to school and have real art lessons. When Tommy gets to school and finds out that the art lessons are full of "rules", he is surprised and dismayed. How the wise art teacher finds a way to give Tommy the freedom to create and stay within the "rules" makes a wonderfully perceptive picture book about growing up and keeping one's individuality.<br><br>Tomie dePaola is the author and illustrator of many beloved books for children, including the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Strega Nona</i>. Fans of all ages will be pleased to hear that <i>The Art Lesson</i> is, in fact, based on the artist's own experiences growing up, and offers a welcome glimpse into his past. This bright picture book is as covered with drawings as the walls of Tommy's parents' and grandparents' houses, and sends an inspirational message to budding artists and individualists. Break out the crayons!</p><p>This is a charming exercise in autobiography (one of several) by the great author-illustrator Tomie dePaola. "Tommy" is consumed with a passion for drawing. Although encouraged by his family, who treat his pictures with respect and decorate their houses and workplaces with them, he encounters misunderstanding and frustration at school. Finally, an art teacher gives him a chance to do his own thing. <i>The Art Lesson</i> is filled with many full-page illustrations in dePaola's inimitably warm, soothing style. It's also packed with the right lessons on individuality and perseverance, especially for children who are already showing a single-minded interest or special talents that put them ahead of their peers. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Richard Farr</i>Tomie dePaola was born in Meriden, Connecticut, in 1934 to a family of Irish and Italian background. By the time he could hold a pencil, he knew what his life's work would be. His determination to create books for children led to a BFA from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and an MFA from the California College of Arts &amp; Crafts in Oakland, California.<p>It drove him through the years of teaching, designing greeting cards and stage sets, and painting church murals until 1965, when he illustrated his first children's book, <i>Sound</i>, by Lisa Miller for Coward-McCann. Eventually, freed of other obligations, he plunged full time into both writing and illustrating children's books.</p><p>He names Fra Angelico and Giotto, Georges Rouault, and Ben Shahn as major influences on his work, but he soon found his own unique style. His particular way with color, line, detail, and design have earned him many of the most prestigious awards in his field, among them a Caldecott Honor Award for <i>Strega Nona</i>, the Smithsonian Medal from the Smithsonian Institution, the Kerlan Award from the University of Minnesota for his "singular attainment in children's literature," the Catholic Library Association's Regina Medal for his "continued distinguished contribution," and the University of Southern Mississippi Medallion.

As sovereign entities, Indian nations have been able to establish policies concerning health care, education, religious freedom, law enforcement, gaming, and taxation. Yet these gains have not gone unchallenged. Starting in the late 1980s, states have tried to regulate and profit from casino gambling on Indian lands. Treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather remain hotly contested, and traditional religious practices have been denied protection. Tribal courts struggle with state and federal courts for jurisdiction. David E. Wilkins and K. Tsianina Lomawaima discuss how the political rights and sovereign status of Indian nations have variously been respected, ignored, terminated, and unilaterally modified by federal lawmakers as a result of the ambivalent political and legal status of tribes under western law.</p></p><p><p><b>David E.

In short, lively chapters, based on the popular <em>History of Philosophy</em> podcast, he offers an accessible, humorous, and detailed look at the emergence of philosophy with the Presocratics, the probing questions of Socrates, and the first full flowering of philosophy with the dialogues of Plato and the treatises of Aristotle. The story is told "without any gaps," discussing not only such major figures but also less commonly discussed topics like the Hippocratic Corpus, the Platonic Academy, and the role of women in ancient philosophy. Within the thought of Plato and Aristotle, the reader will find in-depth introductions to major works, such as the <em>Republic</em> and the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, which are treated in detail that is unusual in an introduction to ancient philosophy. Adamson looks at fascinating but less frequently read Platonic dialogues like the <em>Charmides</em> and <em>Cratylus</em>, and Aristotle's ideas in zoology and poetics. This full coverage allows him to tackle ancient discussions in all areas of philosophy, including epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of language, philosophy of science, ethics and politics. Attention is also given to the historical and literary context of classical philosophy, with exploration of how early Greek cosmology responded to the poets Homer and Hesiod, how Socrates was presented by the comic playwright Aristophanes and the historian Xenophon, and how events in Greek history may have influenced Plato's thought. This is a new kind of history which will bring philosophy to life for all readers, including those coming to the subject for the first time.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Adamson</strong> took his doctorate from the University of Notre Dame and first worked at King's College London. In 2012 he moved to the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, where he is Professor of Late Ancient and Arabic Philosophy. He has published widely in ancient and medieval philosophy, especially on Neoplatonism and on philosophy in the Islamic world.<br><br>"This book was written in the same lively style as the podcast and should appeal to both general readers and scholars of ancient philosophy...

She is the author of&nbsp;<i>Near Black: White to Black Passing in American Culture&nbsp;</i>(2008).&#x201c;[Baz Dreisinger&#x2019;s] maternal turmoil when her students are denied parole, rearrested, shot, deprived of opportunity or go missing, as well as her teacherly pride in their successes, is the genuine heart of [this] story...The hopeful note on which this book ends... seems in no small part due to the wish that even our harsh system of punishment can explore connections to the world in ways that can push us for the better.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;</b><i>The New York Times Book Review<br><br></i>&#x201c;Norway might as well be another galaxy, considering the description offered in Baz Dreisinger&#x2019;s intriguing new book,&nbsp;<i>Incarceration Nations</i>...The great gift of <i>Incarceration Nations</i> is that, by introducing a wide range of approaches to crime, punishment and questions of justice in diverse countries &#x2014; Rwanda, South Africa, Brazil, Jamaica, Uganda, Singapore, Australia and Norway &#x2014; it forces us to face the reality that American-style punishment has been chosen. It is not normal, natural or inevitable...To be clear, this is not a typical criminal justice reform book stocked with data, policy analyses and prescriptions for change. Nor is it written by a criminal justice expert...The heart and soul of this book are the stories of the people [Dreisinger] encounters along the way.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b><i>The Washington Post<br><br>&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;Incarceration Nations</i>...</i> is a book about hope, inspiration, and new beginnings.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Huffington Post / The Blog<br><br></i>"Dreisinger's refusal to offer sweeping generalizations or simple directives in the name of restorative justice is bold...[<i>Incarceration Nations</i> is] an eye-opening, damning indictment of the American prison system and the way its sins reverberate around the globe."&nbsp;<i>&#x2014;Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>"Powerful...Dreisinger carries out an incisive inquiry into the standards for a just society&#x2019;s humane treatment of its prisoners."&nbsp;<i>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly<br><br></i>"[Baz Dreisinger] spent two years visiting prisons around the world-<i>-Incarceration Nations</i>&nbsp;is the astounding culmination of her undertaking.

Stepping into the conversation with her new book,&nbsp;<i>Incarceration Nations</i>, author and activist Baz Dreisenger takes the debate the a step further, analyzing the philosophies and legislation behind the various prison and judicial systems across the world...Dreisinger...effectively puts the popular zeitgeist of criminal justice under the microscope, guiding the reader through a deep analysis of the prison system&#x2019;s history and motives, as well as through popular conceptions of punishment... <i>Incarceration Nations</i>&nbsp;ultimately does what any good manifesto should do: ask its readers to look outside the comfort zone of their long-held beliefs. While some readers may be more swayed by Dreisinger&#x2019;s calls for prison reform than her views on forgiveness, such views are worthwhile ideals to consider as the people of the world seek to reevaluate the state of their prisons and prisoners.&#x201d;&nbsp;<i>&#x2014;PopMatters<br><br></i>&#x201c;<i>Incarceration Nations</i> is an important book, one that pulls back the curtain on a global human tragedy that, for most of us, is hidden from view. The author&#x2019;s unique ability to draw out the humanity in even the most troubled of souls reflects the passion and understanding she brings to her work. Her Prison-to-College Pipeline program, like her writing class in Uganda and drama workshop in Thailand, is a beacon of light that illuminates a stepping stone on a path to change.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;Woman Around Town<br><i><br></i></i>"<i>Incarceration Nations</i> is a thoughtful, well-written and distressing look at the problems we face in our nation and in the world.

This book is a more than a cry for massive overhaul in prison reform, it gives voice to the silent millions of men and women who live behind prison walls on every continent, and whose suffering is a reflection of our own inhumanity and fear. Forgiveness, payback, restoration, these are the words peppered throughout this well-written work of redemption and identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is living proof that mass incarceration is a virus that infects us all.&#x201d; &#x2014;James McBride, author of&nbsp;<i>The Color of Water&nbsp;</i>and<i>The Good Lord Bird</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>&#x201c;<i>Incarceration Nations</i>&nbsp;sheds important light on the ways that justice systems around the world are similar, as well as their unique aspects. It uncovers both their most horrifying and hopeful parts. Offering historical investigation and myriad facts, and complementing that research with personal experiences and stories of human beings, the book captures the reader into more inquiry about this vast and critical subject. This is a great read for both students of criminal justice, as well as citizens of the world.&#x201d; &#x2014;Debbie Mukamal, Executive Director, Stanford Criminal Justice Center,&nbsp; Stanford Law School<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Despite tacit awareness that the prison crisis is global and that the global prison&#x2019;s modern form is US-generated, work on incarceration is almost always limited by national context. &nbsp;The work of gaining access and trust, of studying multiple intricate systems and national contexts, of traveling long distances and juggling multiple exchanges&#x2014;while achieving depth of focus&#x2014;is surely too great for one scholar. &nbsp;Or so it would seem. &nbsp;Dreisinger&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Incarceration Nations</i>, which documents prisons on four continents, appears to do the impossible. &nbsp;It's a vital work&#x2014;part memoir, part scholarly excavation&#x2014;that manages to inspire even as it chronicles some of the world&#x2019;s most horrific places. &nbsp;Dreisinger&#x2019;s long history of work with the currently and formerly incarcerated is the perfect background and material for weaving an account that asks all of the right questions, setting us on a path while acknowledging that answers are really just the ground for asking anew.&#x201d; &#x2014;Gina Dent, Associate Professor and Chair, Feminist Studies, UC Santa Cruz<br><br>"In&nbsp;<i>Incarceration Nations,</i>&nbsp;Baz Dreisinger makes a truly important contribution to the discussion of one of America's most notorious exports&#x2014;prisons. &nbsp;Observing the American penal landscape through the lens of prisons in nine diverse countries, Dreisinger is able to feel sympathy for both victims and prisoners while showing that nations from Uganda to South Africa to Australia expect more than just punishment and warehousing out of their corrections systems. &nbsp;As deplorable as the conditions in some of those prisons are, America can learn a lot from&nbsp;<i>Incarceration Nations</i>&nbsp;about how to tackle our own mass incarceration dilemma." &nbsp;&#x2014;Vincent Schiraldi,&nbsp;Senior Advisor, NYC&nbsp;Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Incarceration Nations </i>is required reading for anyone concerned about the severity of punishment in America, and that should be all of us. Baz Dreisinger traces our legacy of mass incarceration around the globe. She does it with honesty, courage, and humility over the size of the problem, and yet she finds magical possibilities everywhere she goes when the imprisoned are treated as real persons. There <i>are </i>answers. This book says we can find them.&#x201d; &#x2014;Robert A.

She was &#34;flooded with a causeless joy that has never left me.&#34; In this book the commonplace belief that enlightenment is only for saints comes apart at the seams. Anyone can be enlightened, and all we need to do is ask. * This rare and beautiful account puts Jan Frazier solidly in the tradition of enlightened teachers from J. Krishnamurti to Byron Katie. * Guns and money aren&#39;t going to buy peace of mind. Giving up fear is.</p><p>Jan Frazier is a creative-writing teacher and mother of two adolescents. Her poetry and nonfiction have appeared in the Christian Science Monitor, Yankee, Cimarron Review, and the Minnesota Review, and her poetry collection was published in 2003 by Pudding House. She resides in rural western Massachusetts.The summer she turned 50, Frazier suddenly lost the nearly crippling fear that had plagued her for decades. In its place came love, tears, laughter, ecstasy, delight, bliss, understanding and, eventually, an unshakable "undercurrent of fundamental contentment." This book, she says, is not self-help but a "testimony to a life transformed" and a promise that her experience is open to all. Frazier, a poet, knows how to turn a phrase, but her dated commentary, covering 18 months beginning in August 2003, often evokes the self-absorption and inchoate emotion of an adolescent's diary: "Every single thing I do is a total blast. It's like being stoned, only it's entirely clearheaded." Interspersed with celebratory journal entries are lyrical descriptions of her worshipful encounters with Gurumayi, the controversial "perfected master" whose Siddha Yoga mantra is translated "I bow to my inner Self, who is God." Some readers may find Frazier's unremitting attention to her emotional state tedious, if occasionally worrisome ("I expend a lot of energy to keep from whirling in circles with my arms out to the sides"), while others will perceive deep wisdom in her awakened realization "that being released from fear was independent of being released from bad things happening." <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When she reached the Oak Bridge, she stopped.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;This way&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; the Predator called.</i></p><p><i>The Princess studied the shadows. Little white teeth gnawed at pink fingernails. Finally, she stepped off the path, onto uncertain ground.</i></p><p><i>She had agreed to this meeting in the Ramble, the oldest section of Central Park. There were towering trees here and menacing boulders; cloudy streams and historic bridges. Most of all, there were thirty-eight acres of landscape magic&#x2014;rustic paths that made an entire city disappear.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Did you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did you make decision?&#x201d; the Princess asked, her sweet voice betraying her Russian accent.</i></p><p><i>Forcing a smile, the Predator began a practiced speech, telling the girl everything she hoped to hear.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; the Princess replied, eyes filling with grateful tears. With a hard yank, she broke the valuable chain around her neck. A golden key dangled at the end of it. She held it out to the Predator.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Now that deal is off, please take back.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The Predator frowned. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t take your key, Anya.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;But you said I was free.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;From me,&#x201d; the Predator lied. &#x201c;The rest is not my business.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Anya hesitated. Then she nodded and turned to go, content in the belief that at least the deal between them was dead.</i></p><p>Not exactly,<i> the Predator thought. &#x201c;Anya, stop! Don&#x2019;t move.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The Princess froze. &#x201c;What is problem?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Your gown is caught on a branch. Another step will ruin it.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Gown is special,&#x201d; the Princess wailed. &#x201c;I was told to take care!&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;ll free it.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Squatting in the dirt, the Predator pretended to fuss with the expensive fabric. &#x201c;Princess Pink&#x201d; is what they called it&#x2014;more like bubble-headed bubble gum, the Predator thought, for it wasn&#x2019;t the dress that was caught, but the girl who wore it.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You are so kind to help,&#x201d; the Princess said.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Almost done,&#x201d; the Predator promised, getting the needle ready.

In mere minutes, shadows would lengthen; the late afternoon breeze would take on a corpselike chill. That&#x2019;s when the drug would do its work, and this beauty&#x2014;like the troublesome little pet she was&#x2014;would be put to sleep.</i></p><p><i>The Predator smiled at a job well done, barely hearing the tinny speakers of the Delacorte Theater, quieting brats with an ancient phrase.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Once upon a time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>ONE</p><p>Control your own destiny or someone else will.</p><p>&#x2014;JACK WELCH</p><p><b>Once upon that morning&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</b></p><p>&#x201c;WHAT&#x2019;S the matter with you, Clare? Don&#x2019;t you want a little magic in your life?&#x201d;</p><p>My ex-husband thrummed his fingers on our coffee truck&#x2019;s countertop.</p><p>I refilled the napkin holders, ignoring him.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; he pressed, &#x201c;nearly every member of our staff has visited our resident gypsy, everyone but you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve told you, Matt. I&#x2019;ve sworn off fortune telling.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But today is special&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What will it take to get through to you? Maybe I should text you? Adopt our daughter&#x2019;s favorite way of indicating emphasis by using periods after every word: <i>I. Am. Not. Reading. Coffee. Grinds. Today.</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;m not asking you to. I simply want Madame Tesla to read <i>yours</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>I took a breath for patience. This morning had started out so perfectly. The brisk October dawn had painted the sky with a golden light, making Central Park&#x2019;s dewy grass glisten like a fairy glen. Even the chill in the air was ideal for enjoying my freshly roasted coffee.</p><p>New York&#x2019;s favorite waking potion was something I usually brewed downtown, among the picturesque lanes of the historic West Village. But today I&#x2019;d joined a few of my baristas on our coffee truck. By 8 AM, we were stocked up and parked in our assigned spot with the other food vendors near Central Park&#x2019;s Turtle Pond, a stone&#x2019;s throw from the Delacorte Theater, home of Shakespeare in the Park.</p><p>The only real challenge facing me at this early hour was Matteo Allegro&#x2014;my former partner in marriage and current partner in business.</p><p>&#x201c;Look, Matt, I realize you&#x2019;re trying to get some buzz going for these so-called &#x2018;magic beans&#x2019; you&#x2019;ve sourced from Ethiopia, but you&#x2019;re the one handling the Seer&#x2019;s tent. Why do I have to be involved?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Our gypsy knows you learned tasseography from your grandmother. If you don&#x2019;t let her show off for you, she&#x2019;ll be insulted, and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me the truth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I did. That&#x2019;s the reason!&#x201d; One look at my expression and he threw up his hands. &#x201c;Look, even if it isn&#x2019;t, what harm is there in humoring a nice old lady?&#x201d; Matt&#x2019;s big, brown bedroom eyes were now blinking at me. This was his &#x201c;hurt little boy&#x201d; look, the one designed to make me feel guilty.</p><p><i>Unfortunately, it did. But like a lot of things that preyed upon me lately, I ignored it.</i></p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m too busy,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;You are not&#x2014;&#x201d; Matt tapped his watch. &#x201c;The Kingdom doesn&#x2019;t open for another hour&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Kingdom&#x201d; was New York&#x2019;s inaugural Storybook Kingdom, a weekend festival celebrating the Brothers Grimm, Mother Goose, and classic literary characters beloved by children of all ages. In sixty minutes, families would be streaming into this Central Park compound for arts and crafts, costume contests, even a Fairy Tale Village with jugglers, puppeteers, and knights in shining armor. The whole production was dreamed up by the mayor&#x2019;s office. And since Matt&#x2019;s mother&#x2014;our esteemed octogenarian employer&#x2014;happened to sit on the Fairy Tale Fall events committee, we were roped into service.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re done setting up, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Matt pressed.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but the festival staff has kept us hopping since we parked. Here comes another wave&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Matt stepped back as Esther and I filled coffee drink orders for two knights, a court jester, and a half-dressed dragon. When I looked up again, I saw that Matt&#x2019;s focus on fortune telling had finally shifted&#x2014;to a slinky princess in scarlet.</p><p>The young woman&#x2019;s gown had a full, filmy skirt that sparkled in the morning sun. Its stunning red color was repeated in the bright streaks streaming through her soot black, chin-length hair.</p><p>&#x201c;Has Pink Princess come by for coffee?&#x201d; she asked Matt, her low voice hinting at a Russian accent.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. What does the Pink Princess look like?&#x201d;</p><p>The Red Princess laughed. &#x201c;If you saw her, you would not be asking! My friend is gorgeous. Long blond hair, nearly to waist, and she is very much taller than I.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry, I haven&#x2019;t seen her,&#x201d; Matt replied.</p><p>&#x201c;If you do, tell her to call Red.&#x201d;</p><p>Matt smiled. &#x201c;You have a phone in that getup?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is strapped to my thigh,&#x201d; the girl informed him with a playful wink. &#x201c;<i>And</i> is set on vibrate. Want to see?&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head, hardly surprised by the flirtation. Well into his forties, my ex was old enough to be the young woman&#x2019;s father, yet his muscular good looks and world-traveler ease made him the most attractive man in sight.</p><p>When we were married, Matt&#x2019;s standard uniform was paint-stained jeans and a flannel shirt. Now that he&#x2019;d hitched himself to a fashion-forward spouse, Matt was slicker than a <i>GQ</i> cover model.</p><p>Today&#x2019;s ensemble featured a jacket of stag brown suede tailored to his broad shoulders. His dark hair looked rakish against his bronzed complexion, burnished from a recent sourcing trip to East Africa. His toothy smile dazzled and his dark eyes smoldered. The true trick to Matt&#x2019;s appeal, however, was his appetite. When Matt liked a woman, he let her know it. And he pretty much liked them all.</p><p>Of course, none of these things enchanted me. When you&#x2019;ve lived behind a magician&#x2019;s curtain long enough, tricks lose their thrill.</p><p>What did surprise me was my ex-husband&#x2019;s rejection of Red&#x2019;s less than subtle invitation to watch her phone vibrate.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, no, that&#x2019;s okay&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He told her, rubbing the back of his neck. He actually looked a little embarrassed. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ll keep an eye out for your friend.&#x201d;</p><p>Red didn&#x2019;t appear bothered in the least by Matt&#x2019;s response.</p><p>&#x201c;You are a prince!&#x201d; she declared, and in a gesture that would prove astoundingly prophetic, she raised her fairy wand and tapped Matt&#x2019;s forehead before gliding away.</p><p></p><p></p><p>TWO</p><p>&#x201c;WHO was that young woman?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Red Princess,&#x201d; Matt replied with a shrug. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s looking for her friend, the <i>Pink</i> Princess. How many princesses are in this Kingdom anyway?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, but do me a favor and keep your pants on. This is a fall fantasy, not a male fantasy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Give me a little credit, will you? That girl is our daughter&#x2019;s age. Now where&#x2019;s Dante?&#x201d;</p><p>Dante Silva was my <i>artista</i> barista&#x2014;fine arts painter by day, java jockey by night.</p><p>&#x201c;Why do you need Dante?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I want him to relieve you so you can visit the fortune-telling tent.&#x201d;</p><p>I resisted the urge to scream. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s busy inflating the balloon Giant out back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Balloon Giant?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s part of our <i>Jack and the Beanstalk</i> theme.&#x201d; I used my finger to draw a giant air circle. &#x201c;Are you blind?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, is that what these dangling vinyl vines on the truck are for? And the fake cow by the picnic tables?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perceptive, aren&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not entirely.&#x201d; Matt smirked. &#x201c;For instance, I have no idea why you&#x2019;re dressed like a Tyrolean peasant.

Delta Force Officer Charley Castillo and his ever-expanding band of clandestine warriors follow a presidential order to find and rescue a DEA agent kidnapped by drug traffickers in Paraguay. Narrator Dick Hill presents a crisp, well-articulated reading of this typical Griffin story, which is packed with exciting characters and situations. Hill's effectiveness as a narrator is apparent, but dealing with the different personalities and accents does present some challenges.

Peter, because he's the oldest, must deal with Fudgie's disgusting cuteness, his constant meddling with Peter's stuff, and other grave offenses, one of which is almost too much to bear. All these incidents are presented with the unfailing ear and big-hearted humor of the masterful Judy Blume.

When God is our ally, as He was on the Cross, we can be sure that the victory is ours.</p><p>The life and teachings of Venerable Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen anticipated and embodied the spirit of both the Second Vatican Council and the New Evangelization. A gifted orator and writer, he was a pioneer in the use of media for evangelization: His radio and television broadcasts reached an estimated 30 million weekly viewers. He also wrote more than 60 works on Christian living and theology, many of which are still in print. Born in 1895, Sheen grew up in Peoria, Illinois, and was ordained a priest for the diocese in 1919. He was ordained an auxiliary bishop in New York City in 1951. As the head of his mission agency, the Society for the Propagation of the Faith (1950 1966), and as Bishop of Rochester (1966-1969), Sheen helped create 9,000 clinics, 10,000 orphanages, and 1,200 schools; and his contributions educated 80,000 seminarians and 9,000 religious. Upon his death in 1979, Sheen was buried at St. Patrick&#39;s Cathedral in New York. His cause for canonization was returned to his home diocese of Peoria in January 2011, and Sheen was proclaimed &#34;Venerable&#34; by Pope Benedict XVI on June 28, 2012. The first miracle attributed to his intercession was approved in March 2014, paving the way for his beatification.</p><h2>Rock Crystal (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>Seemingly the simplest of stories&#x2014;a passing anecdote of village life&#x2014; Rock Crystal opens up into a tale of almost unendurable suspense. This jewel-like novella by the writer that Thomas Mann praised as "one of the most extraordinary, the most enigmatic, the most secretly daring and the most strangely gripping narrators in world literature" is among the most unusual, moving, and memorable of Christmas stories. Two children&#x2014;Conrad and his little sister, Sanna&#x2014;set out from their village high up in the Alps to visit their grandparents in the neighboring valley. It is the day before Christmas but the weather is mild, though of course night falls early in December and the children are warned not to linger. The grandparents welcome the children with presents and pack them off with kisses. Then snow begins to fall, ever more thickly and steadily. Undaunted, the children press on, only to take a wrong turn. The snow rises higher and higher, time passes: it is deep night when the sky clears and Conrad and Sanna discover themselves out on a glacier, terrifying and beautiful, the heart of the void. Adalbert Stifter's rapt and enigmatic tale, beautifully translated by Elizabeth Mayer and Marianne Moore, explores what can be found between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day&#x2014;or on any night of the year.</p><p><b>Adalbert Stifter</b> (1805&#x2013;1868), the Austrian writer, poet, and painter, grew up in Bohemia and was educated at the University of Vienna. Among his most famous works are the novel <i>Indian Summer</i> and a collection of stories,<i> Colored Stones</i>.<br><br><b>Fanny Howe</b>, the author of more than twenty books of poetry and prose, was the recipient of the 2001 Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize for her Selected Poems. She was short-listed for the Griffin Poetry Prize in 2001 and 2005.<br><br><b>Marianne Moore</b> (1887&#x2013;1972) is universally recognized as one of America&#x2019;s finest poets. <br><br><b>Elizabeth Mayer</b> (1884&#x2013;1970) was a German-born American translator and editor."Two children, Conrad and Sanna, walk from their village in the Alps to visit their grandparents the day before Christmas. On their journey home, they take a wrong turn and are feared lost in a snowstorm. Lyrical and descriptive, this brief tale by Austrian writer, poet, and painter Stifter (1805&#x2013;68) will do well where literary fiction is appreciated." --<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>"On one level it can appear as timeless and simple as a folktale. Yet Thomas Mann came closer to the true experience of reading <i>Rock Crystal</i> when he praised Stifter as 'one of the most extraordinary, the most enigmatic, the most secretly daring and the most strangely gripping narrators in world literature.' In <i>Rock Crystal</i>, as in a Mann story, plot and description are never 'innocent,' no matter how lovingly they are elaborated. Rather, as the novella unfolds, succinctly but without hurry, it evolves into a parable of frightening depth. It is no more than 25,000 words, if that, but in this short space Stifter transports the reader to the heart of the world's mystery, before returning him to a comfortable dailiness that henceforth cannot help but feel haunted." --<i>The New York Sun</i><br><br>&#x201c;A miracle of quiet beauty.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The New Yorker</i><br><br>&#x201c;W. H. Auden in <i>The Times</i> called this ingenuous, mystical tale &#x2018;a quiet and beautiful parable about the relation of people to places, of man to nature.&#x2019; ...Beyond its leisurely beginning lies a painstakingly polished and fashioned gem, an ageless, mystical folktale whose return deserves a 12 month celebration.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The New York Times, </i>1965<br><br>&#x201c;[<i>Rock Crystal</i>] has remained dear to the hearts of lovers of German literature. A beautiful new translation by Elizabeth Mayer and Marianne Moore...It&#x2019;s account of the courage and faith of little children and its reverent feeling for the beauty of nature and for the sacred symbolism of Christmas have a value that has little to do with literature. It is one of pure feeling.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The New York Times, </i>1945<br><br>&#x201c;Adalbert Stifter is ranked by critics among the best prose writers of Austria. We do not think the praise is too high.&#x201d; <i>&#x2013;The Christian Examiner</i><br><br>&#x201c;The work of Adalbert Stifter, who was one of the very few great novelists in German literature, can be compared to no other writer of the nineteenth century in pure happiness, wisdom, and beauty... Stifter became the greatest landscape-painter in literature...someone who possesses the magic wand to transform all visible things into words and all visible movements&#x2013;into sentences.&#x201d; &#x2013;Hannah Arendt <br><br>&#x201c;Whereas romances are rarely fearsome, even when teeming with dragons, tales quite often are. The fear that must underlie even our most cordial relation with the elements has an established place in them. I think of <i>Rock Crystal</i> (<i>Bergkristalle</i>) in the wonderful collection <i>Colored Stones</i> (<i>Bunte Steine</i>, 1853) of the Austrian Adalbert Stifter; it tells of two children, brother and sister, lost in a mountain snowstorm at Christmas-time while returning from a custom-honored three-hour walk to their grandmother's house down the valley. The quite ordinary and familiar two-horned alp traversed by the shoemaker's children is a mountain more magic than any of Thomas Mann's imagining.&#x201d; &#x2013;Mary McCarthy, <i>The New York Review of Books</i></p><h2>Hypercapitalism: The Modern Economy, Its Values, and How to Change Them</h2><p><b>PAPERBACK ORIGINAL From the bestselling cartoonist of <i>The Cartoon History of the Universe</i> comes an explosive graphic takedown of capitalism</b><br><br>Bestselling &#x201c;overeducated cartoonist&#x201d; Larry Gonick has delighted readers for years with sharp, digestible, and funny accounts of everything from the history of the universe to the intricacies of calculus.

Child, a professor and a member of the Red Lake Ojibwe tribe, gives Native American women their due, detailing the many ways in which they have shaped Native American life. She illuminates the lives of women such as Madeleine Cadotte, who became a powerful mediator between her people and European fur traders, and Gertrude Buckanaga, whose postwar community activism in Minneapolis helped bring many Indian families out of poverty. Moving from the early days of trade with Europeans through the reservation era and beyond, Child offers a powerful tribute to the courageous women who sustained Native American communities through the darkest challenges of the past three centuries.</p></p><p><b>Brenda J. Child</b> is an associate professor of American studies at the University of Minnesota and the author of <i>Boarding School Seasons: American Indian Families: 1900&#x2013;1940</i>. She lives in Saint Paul, Minnesota.In this latest volume in the Penguin Library of American Indian History, Child addresses the unique role women have played in the community life of her nation, the Red Lake Ojibwe Nation of northern Minnesota. She begins with a history of Ojibwe culture in the Great Lakes area since the late eighteenth-century, when women served as intermediaries with the European newcomers, especially fur traders. In the reservation era, women were called on to &#x201c;hold things together,&#x201d; as the move to reservations disrupted the politics and resources of the Ojibwe people, forcing them to make difficult decisions as each treaty with the U.S. and Canada was signed. Child addresses the travesty of Indian boarding schools, focusing on the one started near Mount Pleasant, Michigan, in 1893 on sacred Ojibwe burial grounds. She concludes with the post-WWII Ojibwe migration to Minneapolis, where women quickly adopted leadership positions in activist groups. Child offers a penetrating look into how crucial Ojibwe women have been over the last two centuries in holding the Ojibwe Nation together against forces threatening to tear it apart. --Deborah Donovan</p><h2>Rescue and Redeem: Volume 5: Chronicles of the Modern Church (History Lives)</h2><p><p>Experience history without the wooliness, and with all the wonder in this history designed for .

"There are only sacred places and desecrated places." <br><br>What might it mean to behold the world with such depth and feeling that it is no longer possible to imagine it as something separate from ourselves, or to live without regard for its well-being? To understand the work of seeing things as an utterly involving moral and spiritual act? Such questions have long occupied the center of contemplative spiritual traditions. In <em>The Blue Sapphire of the Mind</em>, Douglas E. Christie proposes a distinctively contemplative approach to ecological thought and practice that can help restore our sense of the earth as a sacred place. Drawing on the insights of the early Christian monastics as well as the ecological writings of Henry David Thoreau, Aldo Leopold, Annie Dillard, and many others, Christie argues that, at the most basic level, it is the quality of our attention to the natural world that must change if we are to learn how to live in a sustainable relationship with other living organisms and with one another. He notes that in this uniquely challenging historical moment, there is a deep and pervasive hunger for a less fragmented and more integrated way of apprehending and inhabiting the living world--and for a way of responding to the ecological crisis that expresses our deepest moral and spiritual values. Christie explores how the wisdom of ancient and modern contemplative traditions can inspire both an honest reckoning with the destructive patterns of thought and behavior that have contributed so much to our current crisis, and a greater sense of care and responsibility for all living beings. These traditions can help us cultivate the simple, spacious awareness of the enduring beauty and wholeness of the natural world that will be necessary if we are to live with greater purpose and meaning, and with less harm, to our planet.<br></p><p><br><strong>Douglas E. Christie</strong> is Professor of Theological Studies, Loyola Marymount University, and the author of <em>The Word in the Desert: Scripture and the Quest for Holiness in Early Christian Monasticism</em>.<br><br>"This beautifully written book will be of great value to scholars and is suitable for graduate courses on contemplative traditions and on religion and ecology."--<em>Religious Studies Review</em><p></p><br>"At once a personal journey, a scholarly treatise and a heartfelt plea, Douglas E. Christie draws on personal vignettes, his command of early Christian resources and his wide ranging study of contemporary nature to compose a dense yet beautifully crafted scholarly treatise that manages at the same time to be intensely personal. . . He wants to lift up the significance of spirituality in helping us to think about the meaning and significance of the natural world in our own lives and to formulate a meaningful response to the growing erosion of the natural world. Much will depend on our willingness to risk the kind of relinquishment that the contemplative traditions claim is essential for real and lasting personal and social transformation."--<em>Spiritus</em><p></p><br>"This book is a remarkable and profound effort to bring into conversation and correlation the modern ecological consciousness together with the wisdom and practice embodied in the Christian contemplative tradition."--<em>Cistercian Studies Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"An excellent guide for those wishing to carry forward their Advent and Christmas reflections on the relationship between the <em>Logos&amp;R and our material world. It presents a helpful collection of ancient and modern contemplative thought that can help bring us to an integrated view of nature and</em> <em>ourselves." --National Catholic Reporter<p></p></em><br>"The book is a veritable feast of wisdom... With consummate intelligence and probing imagination Christie lures us into seeing the beauty that lies at the heart of our broken world... <em>The Blue Sapphire of the Mind</em> is a beautiful and important book, evocative and alluring, creative and often subtle as it leads us to encounter theological themes in fresh ways." --<em>Christian Century</em> <br><p></p><br>"Christie has written a book that is at once beautiful and scholarly, both lyrical in its prose and impressive in its erudition...<em>The Blue Sapphire of the Mind</em> is a book to savor, a book full of surprising connections and beautiful images, and absolutely a book that leaves the reader with newfound hope about the future of our broken, beloved Earth."--<em>Journal of the American Academy of Religion</em><p></p><br>"Christie has created an important work, well worth the effort of reading...Christie has produced a welcome addition to an underdeveloped but sorely needed topic."--<em>Parabola</em><p></p><br>"[A] profound and profoundly important book...Those who desire to live in touch with and to participate in the restoration of this luminous and possibly numinous earth will deeply appreciate <em>The Blue Sapphire of the Mind</em>."--<em>Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment</em><p></p><br>"Those in search of relevant and in-depth bibliography for thinking about the past, present, and future of the human spiritual relationship to the natural world will be turning to this book for many years to come...Libraries should have this book. General readers will be fascinated by its timely topic, spiritual depth, and engaging style, while researchers will be attracted by its intellectual breadth and extensive bibliography. While its use as a main class text may be limited to courses with ecospirituality as their primary theme, it could easily appear as a recommended text in a wide range of courses in theology, ethics, and spirituality."--<em>Horizons</em><p></p><br>"In this remarkable book, Douglas Christie, a theologian and academic, sets out to explore the concept of contemplative ecology ... The writing is sparse and deep, clear and beckoning. " --<em>Times Higher Education</em><p></p><br>"With this book Douglas E. Christie joins the ranks of Annie Dillard and Wendell Berry in their explorations of the challenge of spirituality to awaken and us to attend to the environment. Yet with Christie there is something quite unique in his contribution. He brings to bear his intimate and scholarly knowledge of the Christian contemplative tradition on the most urgent ecological matters on our time."--Martin Laird, O.S.A., author of <em>Into the Silent Land and A Sunlit Absence</em><p></p><br>"There is no one as qualified as Douglas Christie to write a book such as this. Along with impeccable scholarship, he brings eloquence, passion, depth, and experience to the discussion. Surely we need a contemplative ecology and this is a masterful work that shows us the path."--Mary Evelyn Tucker, Forum on Religion and Ecology at Yale<p></p><br>"This movingly autobiographical and deeply interdisciplinary book links ancient monastic practices of contemplation to modern environmental ideas, especially as they are reflected in works of modern and contemporary American literature. In emphasizing acts of creative attention and the spiritual necessity of mourning our lost sacred places, Christie gives the humanities a central role in addressing the environmental crisis of our time."--H.

On one side, their neighbors are the proper Pendennis family, recently arrived from Baltimore, whose close-in-age boys&#x2014;Sidney, Albert and Ashbridge&#x2014;shake their father&#x2019;s hand at breakfast and address him as &#x201c;sir.&#x201d; On the other side is the Pitt family: a &#x201c;resolutely French&#x201d; mother, a former navy captain father, and two brothers, Archie and Daniel, who are clearly &#x201c;going to grow up into a pair of daredevils and adventurers.&#x201d; In childhood this band is inseparable, but the days of careless camaraderie are brought to an abrupt halt by the outbreak of The Great War, in which everyone will play a part.<br> &nbsp;<br> All three Pendennis brothers fight in the hellish trenches at the front; Daniel Pitt becomes an ace fighter pilot with his daredevil tendencies intact; Rosie and Ottilie McCosh volunteer in the hospitals, where women serve with as much passion and nearly as much hardship as the men at the front; Christabel McCosh becomes one of the squad of photographers sending &#x201c;snaps&#x201d; of their loved ones at home to the soldiers; and Sophie McCosh drives for the RAF in France.

In Marseilles, President Kruger of South Africa, fleeing into exile laden with wealth stolen from his own people, raised the rabble to new frenzies of anti-Britishness, and hotels where British travellers were thought to be staying were besieged.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Queen grew drowsy. She had never before shown any lapse of energy or attention, but now she nodded off even at crucial moments. She received a letter from a boy bugler in the Devons, telling her how he had been the one to sound the charge at Waggon Hill, and she managed to reply to it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Queen travelled from London to Osborne House, on the Isle of Wight. She loved it there, and had long considered it to be her real family home. She had her own little beach with a bathing hut, and there was a miniature house where her children, now scattered across Europe, used to play when Albert was still alive. Across the Solent she could visit the vast military hospital that she had set up at Netley, bringing the scarves that she liked to knit for the wounded soldiers.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Queen found that she could not speak when the Brazilian ambassador came to present his credentials. She was forgetting how to talk. She failed to recognise Lord Roberts when he returned in triumph from South Africa in order to become the new Commander-in-Chief. He was bewildered and grief-stricken.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Queen performed her last great imperial act, and proclaimed the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia. Her visit to the Riviera was cancelled, and the Keeper of the Privy Purse was obliged to pay out �800 in compensation to the Hotel Cimiez.<br> &nbsp;<br> It had been so long since the death of a sovereign that no one knew what to say, or how to behave. Lord Salisbury refused to talk about the accession ceremonies because it was too upsetting. The well-to-do cancelled their dinner parties and balls, and the frivolous optimism that had accompanied the arrival of a new century evaporated. It was January, and the dark clouds that wept rain onto the land complemented the mood of the people beneath them. <br> &nbsp;<br> The Queen&#x2019;s relatives and descendants converged on Osborne from all over Europe. In South Africa the war that was supposed to have been won already was carried on by Botha, Smuts and de Wet. Money and young men continued to be expended. The British troops were killed mainly by enteric fever. <br> &nbsp;<br> The tiny Queen died. The Lord Mayor of London was informed, and then the rest of the world. Whilst the nation lay stunned, the Great argued about what should be done next. Lord Acton announced that King Edward VII could not call himself Edward VII because he was not descended from previous Edwards. Did the Lord Mayor of London count as an ex-officio member of the Privy Council? He decided that he did, and gatecrashed it. Who was in charge of the funeral? Was it the Lord Chamberlain or the Duke of Norfolk, even though he was a Catholic? The Duke insisted on his historic right, and the King conceded. Lady Cadogan received an invitation to the interment that was intended for her husband, in which she was requested to come wearing trousers. <br> &nbsp;<br> The Queen&#x2019;s coffin was so minute that it might have been that of a child. King Edward and the Kaiser walked behind it as it was drawn through Cowes. It came across the Solent in a battle-ship, flanked by the greatest fleet in the world. In London the route from Victoria Station to Buckingham Palace then Paddington Station was blocked solid with mourners hoping to see the great procession of the gun carriage. Behind it rode King Edward, flanked by the Duke of Connaught and Kaiser Wilhelm, followed by the handsome and slim Crown Prince of Germany, the embodiment of hope for his nation, the guarantor of its great future as a beacon of civilisation. <br> &nbsp;<br> The Queen&#x2019;s body was laid to rest at Windsor. The grandmother of Europe had gone, and everyone knew as if by instinct that a momentous era had suddenly ended. She left behind railways that ran at sixty miles an hour, with carriages that nowadays had roofs on them. Vast liners crossed the Atlantic in two weeks. Bull-baiting had gone, and there was a society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and another for the prevention of cruelty to children. Swearing had become taboo in polite society, and aristocratic men no longer got so drunk at dinner parties that ladies had to make their escape through the windows. There were now aerated bread shops, and Lyons Corner Houses where one was served by &#x2018;Nippies&#x2019; in white frilly aprons. Anybody these days could buy coffee. The River Fleet was no longer an open sewer. Many had electric light, and there was clean water laid on in the working-class districts for half an hour every day, except for Sundays, causing an awful elbowing on Saturdays. Motor cars no longer caught fire when you started them up. They had, however, spoiled the evening drive in hansoms through Hyde Park. The cult of respect-ability had introduced a blessed order into people&#x2019;s lives, and at the same time opened the door for marvellous hypocrisy. <br> &nbsp;<br> Much as the people had loved their tiny Queen, there had been something dull about all that respectability, and the grief and stupefaction that had engulfed her subjects was tempered by the anticipation of something that might be more entertaining. The new King was a bon viveur. He loved France rather than Germany. He consorted with actresses. For the last ten years, in any case, the Victorian age had already been slipping away. Fast girls smoked, and wore the most shocking bloomers when they went out on their bicycles. Businesswomen of dubious morality were getting jobs in the City. Saddlers who specialised in side-saddles found their orders drying up. Crowds filled the music halls to hear smutty songs rendered by cheeky chappies and saucy doxies. <br> &nbsp;<br> The new King, kept strictly in the dark about state matters during his mother&#x2019;s reign, grew impatient with precedent and forged a new path. He upset everyone at court. He gave the right to organise his coronation to the Catholic Duke of Norfolk and not to the Anglican Lord Chamberlain. There was a long and bitter dispute about whether the Lords should be robed, and the decision was changed four times. He sent Lord Carrington, a notorious liberal, as his personal envoy to France, Spain and Portugal. This was the same Lord Carrington who had once, as one of a panel of magistrates that had tried him, scandalously paid the fine of a newly released convict, caught sleeping rough when he had not been able to walk to High Wycombe before darkness fell. The alternative had been several more months in prison, and Carrington had resigned from the bench immediately afterwards, saying that if this was justice he wanted nothing more to do with it. <br> &nbsp;<br> The King dragged Lord Wolsey from retirement, and sent him abroad, with sashes and medals to present to foreign potentates, even the Shah of Iran, who thereby became the first Muslim to become a member of the Christian Order of the Garter. He cleared out his mother&#x2019;s immense accumulation of bric-a-brac, updated his plumbing, filled his court with men who were interesting rather than important, and with women who were both interesting and beautiful. <br> &nbsp;<br> In Court Road, Eltham, on 9 August 1902, Mr and Mrs Hamilton McCosh held a coronation party, postponed from June. It was to be a kind of elaborate high tea. They borrowed long trestles from several firms of wallpaperers, covered them with beautiful damask cloths, and, at greatly inflated prices, hired enough plain china plates and silver-plated cutlery to see them through the day. The servants set up two long tables in the garden, to accommodate the buffet, and laid out rugs all over the lawn and in the orchard in order to create a grand <i>d�jeuner sur l&#x2019;herbe</i>. Chairs were brought out of the house for the elderly or stiff of limb. From the kitchen there appeared plates of ham and tongue, elaborate salads in the French style, Normandy cheeses, and fabulous heaps of fresh Kentish strawberries and Devon cream. For the children there was lemonade, and for the adults jugs of potent fruit cup with sprigs of mint floating on the surface. Chilled champagne would be brought out in time for a toast to the King after Mr McCosh had made his speech. <br> &nbsp;<br> This was the beginning of the age when riches would finally come to count as much as rank. Court Road consisted of very large detached houses with substantial gardens at the rear. Most had two gateways connected by a small semicircular driveway out in the front so that carriages could arrive and leave without any awkward manoeuvring. The McCosh entrance and exit had impressive brick pillars with the grampians set into them in Portland stone. Between them ran a low wall, just the right height for children to walk along. Mr McCosh had planted a small walnut tree just behind it, because he loved the way the leaves turned yellow in autumn, and was convinced that walnut was the hard-wood of the future, without thought to the possibility that long after his death the tree&#x2019;s roots would topple the pillars and wall altogether, so that by the end of the century there would be no memory of the house ever having had a name at all. <br> &nbsp;<br> Inside were large rooms with high ceilings and small coal fires. On the top floor were crudely furnished rooms with washstands for the servants, but on the floor below that there was a proper bathroom with a real lion-footed cast-iron bath that gave hot water from a boiler house attached to the side of the kitchen. In this boiler house was often to be found the boilerman, dozing in the warmth, or rolling cigarettes, and occasionally getting up to shovel in a new dose of coal. His was a life of bucolic idleness, disrupted only by the occasional breakdown of the whole system, which worked on the thermosyphon principle, without any need of a pump at all. <br> &nbsp;<br> In general one could gauge the success of the householders of Court Road by the elaborateness of their cornices. Mr McCosh was an intelligent, charming, humane, ambitious, hard-working man with an eye to anything whatsoever that might turn a profit, and The Grampians had by far the most elaborate, extensive and delicate cornices of any house in Court Road. His chief weakness, which he was able to turn to profit even so, was an addiction to golf. He was often to be found playing rounds at the Blackheath when he was supposed to be in his London office. <br> &nbsp;<br> One disadvantage of his speculations was that he might veer from fabulous riches to abject penury in the blink of an eye. He was accustomed to avoiding paying bills until such time as he recouped his wealth. This he always did, but it remained a sore point to the local tradesmen, who never knew when it was wise to accept his custom or decline it. Their one consolation was that he scrupulously calculated the interest on any debt he owed, and paid it in full.<br> &nbsp;<br> On 9 August 1902 Mr Hamilton McCosh had plenty of money, it seemed unlikely that it was going to rain, and he was rejoicing in the pleasure of his own largesse.<br> &nbsp;<br> By his side, frequently departing from it in order to direct the servants, stood his wife. Mrs McCosh had been a great beauty in her youth, and was to retain her comeliness into old age. She was seven years senior to her husband, and had married late owing to a long previous engagement to a milord who subsequently turned out to have had a wife already, locked up in an asylum in New York. It had taken her many years to recover from the mortification of the scandal having become public and being written up in the press, and she had virtually gone into seclusion until the gallant and impervious Hamilton McCosh had hauled her out of it. She had caused much gossip by playing tennis vigorously when pregnant, and was notorious for her outspoken belief that women should vote equally with men. She had become a warrior in what was being called &#x2018;the Sex War&#x2019;. However, her husband would explain that this was because she wanted the right to vote Conservative. She had recently taken up cycling and was still somewhat bruised about the thighs after losing a wheel during a tour of Hayling Island.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs McCosh&#x2019;s great weakness was for the royal family. She followed their doings avidly, and subscribed to <i>The Times </i>only to peruse the Court Circular. The coronation party was her idea, even though most of the nation had already feasted a month before, when the King had donated �30,000 to the poor of London, and 456,000 people had eaten and drunk at his expense. The King himself, recovering in bed from an operation, had sent his regrets to each Lord Mayor, and the Prince and Princess of Wales had made up for his absence by visiting twenty of the dinner parties in succession. It had all felt like a wonderful new start. <br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs McCosh was looking forward to the coronation party, but also wondered if she could bear to see it through, because she was still in deep mourning for the Queen, and had only this very day given up wearing black. She was not at all sure that she approved of the new King, who kept racehorses and had dismissed many of the old Queen&#x2019;s retainers. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I do hope that His Majesty is fully recovered,&#x2019; she said to her husband, somewhat insincerely. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;What was it again?&#x2019; he asked. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Peritiphylitis.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Sounds dreadful. What on earth is it?&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Darling, I&#x2019;ve told you so many times. It&#x2019;s an infection of something that the appendix hangs from. Anyway, they say he&#x2019;s recovered, but won&#x2019;t be carrying the Sword of State to the altar. I do hope he doesn&#x2019;t collapse.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Kings of Scotland dinna collapse,&#x2019; replied Mr McCosh. &#x2018;They die heroically in battle or get stabbed in their sleep.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;My dear, I hope you are not suggesting that our dear present Queen Alexandra may be something of a Lady Macbeth? She is Danish after all.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Danish monarchs kill their brothers and nephews, if we are to believe the Bard. And women are strange, unscrupulous creatures. And queens are women. And the Danish Queen married her husband&#x2019;s brother, who killed him. A sorry lot, Danish queens.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;You must stop being provocative, my dear. It&#x2019;s fortunate that I&#x2019;m so used to your humour. If that is what one should call it. <i>Hamlet </i>is undoubtedly fiction, as you well know. I do wish one could have been there . . . at the coronation, I mean. I should have loved to see Lord Kitchener all done up in plumes, and Sir Alfred Gaselee. And the new Prime Minister, of course.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Well, my dear, we are exceedingly lucky with the weather. We couldn&#x2019;t have asked for a nicer day. And we have the Eltham aristocracy to entertain. Talking of which, have we set up the table for the tradesmen and artisans?&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Of course.

Her previous books include the bestselling, Wolfson Prize-winning Pompeii, The Roman Triumph, The Parthenon and Confronting the Classics. Her blog has been collected in the books It&#39;s a Don&#39;s Life and All in a Don&#39;s Day. She is in the 2014 top 10 Prospect list of the most influential thinkers in the world.Offering up 30 years of pointed insights and inquisitions, Cambridge classics professor Beard (The Fires of Vesuvius) returns with a collection of primarily reprinted reviews of her classicist peers' work that somehow manages to touch on nearly every notable person, place, and event associated with the Ancient world. But for Beard, while the classics have always been a dialogue with the dead, the dead do not include only those who went to their graves two thousand years ago. Rather, the study of the Classics is the study of what happens in the gap between antiquity and ourselves. It's the back-and-forth sparring between betweeded Oxford dons, it's Picasso and Shakespeare, it's Ben-Hur and Gladiator&#x2014;it's anything that engages in or, as the wonderful title suggests, confronts that gilded and gargantuan Greco-Roman world. So, the chapter about King Minos's legendary palace is much more concerned with how and why Arthur Evans decided to elaborately, and disastrously, restore the site in the early 20th century. The discussion of Cleopatra turns around history's ever-changing, mostly guessing portrait, and ends with Beard finally advising that we just stick with the Augustan myth and Horace's �demented queen.'&nbsp; And then there's her fascinating, gentle dig at the obsessive, retiring Victorian academic Charles Frazer.

By the author of Compelling Evidence. Reprint.</p><p><p>Steve Martini is the author of numerous New York Times bestsellers, including The Enemy Inside, Trader of Secrets, The Rule of Nine, Guardian of Lies, Shadow of Power, Double Tap, and others featuring defense attorney Paul Madriani. Martini has practiced law in California in both state and federal courts and has served as an administrative law judge and supervising hearing officer. He lives in the Pacific Northwest.</p>Defense attorney Paul Madriani (Compelling Evidence, 1992) signs on for a brief stint in the Davenport, California, prosecutor's office--then finds himself condemned to try a high-profile serial killing. Three couples have been murdered by somebody whose MO is distinctively grisly--they're staked to the ground with tent pegs, another peg driven through their hearts--but the third incident is different in enough ways (much older couple, different kind of rope, tent pegs not sharpened to a point) to suggest a copycat killer. Still, after Paul and his investigators turn up Andre Iganovich, a suspect for the first two pairs of murders, everybody--from Paul's impatient wife Nikki to the judges to the Davenport powers that be, even to Adrian Chambers, the venal defense attorney representing Iganovich, and certainly including the anonymous caller threatening Paul's family if he doesn't include the last two murders in the indictment--wants Paul to close the case by pinning all six crimes on Iganovich instead of continuing to search for the copycat. But Paul's determined to track down the missing witness to the last two murders, a man who has his own reasons for keeping quiet about why he was perched in a tree high above the fatal scene. The obligatory impossible obstacles--constant pressure from Paul's old nemesis Judge Armando Acosta; the incompetence and possible treachery of graying junior prosecutor Roland Overroy; an extradition mess when Iganovich flees the country; and the unprincipled enmity of Chambers, on the rebound from a disbarment arranged partly by Paul--come at Paul helter-skelter, without much rhyme or reason, until midway through the book, when the trial begins and Martini rolls up his sleeves to do what he does best. Not as twisty or deeply felt as Compelling Evidence, but not as overwrought either--and the unbelievable ending packs a satisfying punch. Good medium-grade beach fare. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In <em>Bunker Archeology</em>, urbanist Paul Virilio turns his attentionand camerato the ominous yet strangely compelling German bunkers that lie abandoned along the coast of France. These ghostly reminders of destruction and oppression prompted Virilio to consider the nature of war and existence, in relation to both World War II and contemporary times.

It is a transition many fail to make. This book traces the experiences of nineteen new managers over the course of their first year in a managerial capacity. Reveals the complexity of the transition and analyzes the expectations of the managers, their subordinates, and their superiors. New managers describe how they reframed their understanding of their roles and responsibilities, how they learned to build effective work relationships, how and when they used individual and organizational resources, and how they learned to cope with the inevitable stresses of the transformation. They describe what it was like to take on a new identity. Two themes emerge: first the transition from individual contributor to manager is a profound psychological adjustment--a transformation; second, the process of becoming a manager is primarily one of learning from experience. Through trial and error, observation and interpretation, the new managers learned what it took to become effective business leaders.</p><p><br>Linda A.

Initially, these managers focused on formal authority and setting business performance agendas while ignoring the responsibilities of accomplishing things through others and network building. "They were genuinely surprised, though, by the discontinuity between the producer and manager roles and between their expectations and the realities of management." Hill clearly explains the interpersonal problems of dealing with employee diversity and evaluating the performance of others along with the stressful and emotional side of making the transformation to management. She also addresses how new managers can learn from their experiences and the implications for those responsible for management development. Unlike Joseph and Susan Berk's Managing Effectively ( LJ 6/1/91), which examines what first-time managers should know, Hill discusses the actual transformation of individual performers into effective new managers.

I didn&#x2019;t run with the Ritz crowd. Mosquitoes, my husband called them. And maybe I should have listened to my husband. Maybe no good could come from visiting the bar at the Paris Ritz; maybe you were doomed to commit some frivolous and irresponsible act, maybe you were doomed to hover around dangerously until you had drawn the blood from another human being or else had your own blood drawn instead.</p><p>But Johann&#x2014;my husband&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t around that night. I tiptoed in through the unfashionable Place Vend�me entrance on my brother&#x2019;s arm instead, since Johann had been recalled to Berlin for an assignment of a few months that had stretched into several. In those days, you couldn&#x2019;t just flit back and forth between Paris and Berlin, any more than you could flit between heaven and hell; and furthermore, why would you want to? Paris had everything I needed, everything I loved, and Berlin in 1937 was no place for a liberal-minded woman nurturing a young child and an impossible rift in her marriage. I stayed defiantly in France, where you could still attend a party for a man named Greenwald, where anyone could dine where he pleased and shop and bank where he pleased, where you could sleep with anyone who suited you, and it wasn&#x2019;t a crime.</p><p>For the sake of everyone&#x2019;s good time, I suppose it was just as well that my husband remained in Berlin, since Nick Greenwald and Johann von Kleist weren&#x2019;t what you&#x2019;d call bosom friends, for all the obvious reasons. But Nick and I were a different story. Nick and I understood each other: first, because we were both Americans living in Paris, and second, because we shared a little secret together, the kind of secret you could never, ever share with anyone else. Of all my brother&#x2019;s friends, Nick was the only one who didn&#x2019;t resent me for marrying a general in the German army. Good old Nick. He knew I&#x2019;d had my reasons.</p><p>The salon was hot, and Nick was in his shirtsleeves, though he still retained his waistcoat and a neat white bow tie, the kind you needed a valet to arrange properly. He turned at the sound of my voice. &#x201c;Annabelle! Here at last.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not so very late, am I?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>We kissed, and he and Charles shook hands. Not that Charles paid the transaction much attention; he was transfixed by the black-haired beauty who lounged at Nick&#x2019;s side in a shimmering silver-blue dress that matched her eyes. A long cigarette dangled from her fingers. Nick turned to her and placed his hand at the small of her back. &#x201c;Annabelle, Charlie. I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ve met Budgie Byrne. An old college friend.&#x201d;</p><p>We said <i>enchant�e</i>. Miss Byrne took little notice. Her handshake was slender and lacked conviction. She slipped her arm through Nick&#x2019;s and whispered in his ear, and they shimmered off together to the bar inside a haze of expensive perfume. The back of Miss Byrne&#x2019;s dress swooped down almost to the point of no return, and her naked skin was like a spill of milk, kept from running over the edge by Nick&#x2019;s large palm.</p><p>Charles covered his cheek with his right hand&#x2014;the same hand that Miss Byrne had just touched with her limp and slender fingers&#x2014;and said that bastard always got the best-looking women.</p><p>I watched Nick&#x2019;s back disappear into the crowd, and I was about to tell Charles that he didn&#x2019;t need to worry, that Nick didn&#x2019;t really look all that happy with his companion and Charles might want to give the delectably disinterested Miss Byrne another try in an hour, but at that exact instant a voice came over my shoulder, the last voice I expected to hear at the Paris Ritz on this night in the smoldering middle of July.</p><p>&#x201c;My God,&#x201d; it said, a little slurry. &#x201c;If it isn&#x2019;t the baroness herself.&#x201d;</p><p>I thought perhaps I was hallucinating, or mistaken. It wouldn&#x2019;t be the first time. For the past two years, I&#x2019;d heard this voice everywhere: department stores and elevators and street corners. I&#x2019;d seen its owner in every possible nook, in every conceivable disguise, only to discover that the supposed encounter was only a false alarm, a collision of deluded molecules inside my own head, and the proximate cause of the leap in my blood proved to be an ordinary citizen after all. Just an everyday fellow who happened to have dark hair or a deep voice or a certain shape to the back of his neck. In the instant of revelation, I never knew whether to be relieved or disappointed. Whether to lament or hallelujah. Either way, the experience wasn&#x2019;t a pleasant one, at least not in the way we ordinarily experience pleasure, as a benevolent thing that massages the nerves into a sensation of well-being.</p><p>Either way, I had committed a kind of adultery of the heart, hadn&#x2019;t I, and since I couldn&#x2019;t bear the thought of adultery in any form, I learned to ignore the false alarm when it rang and rang and rang. Like the good wife I was, I learned to maintain my poise during these moments of intense delusion.</p><p>So there. Instead of bolting at the slurry word <i>baroness</i>, I took my deluded molecules in hand and said: <i>Surely not.</i></p><p>Instead of spinning like a top, I turned like a figurine on a music box, in such a way that you could almost hear the tinkling Tchaikovsky in my gears.</p><p>A man came into view, quite lifelike, quite familiar, tall and just so in his formal blacks and white points, dark hair curling into his forehead the way your lover&#x2019;s hair does in your wilder dreams. He was holding a lowball glass and a brown Turkish cigarette in his right hand, and he took in everything at a glance: my jewels, my extravagant dress, the exact state of my circulation.</p><p>In short, he seemed an awful lot like the genuine article.</p><p>&#x201c;There you are, you old bastard,&#x201d; said Charles happily, and <i>sacr� bleu</i>, I realized then what I already knew, that the man before me was no delusion. That the Paris Ritz was the kind of place that could conjure up anyone it wanted.</p><p>&#x201c;Stefan,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What a lovely surprise.&#x201d;</p><p>(And the big trouble was, I think I meant it.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First Movement</p><p>&#x201c;Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes.&#x201d;</p><p>OSCAR WILDE</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pepper</p><p>PALM BEACH � 1966</p><p>1.</p><p>The Mercedes-Benz poses on the grass like a swirl of vintage black ink, like no other car in the world.</p><p>You&#x2019;d never guess it to look at her, but Miss Pepper Schuyler&#x2014;that woman right over there, the socialite with the golden antelope legs who&#x2019;s soaking up the Florida sunshine at the other end of the courtyard&#x2014;knows every glamorous inch of this 1936 Special Roadster shadowing the grass. You might regard Pepper&#x2019;s pregnant belly protruding from her green Lilly shift (well, it&#x2019;s hard to ignore a belly like that, isn&#x2019;t it?) and the pastel Jack Rogers sandal dangling from her uppermost toe, and you think you have her pegged. Admit it! Lush young woman exudes Palm Beach class: What the hell does she know about cars?</p><p>Well, beautiful Pepper doesn&#x2019;t give a damn what you think about her. She never did. She&#x2019;s thinking about the car. She slides her gaze along the seductive S-curve of the right side fender, swooping from the top of the tire to the running board below the door, like a woman&#x2019;s voluptuously naked leg, and her hearts beats a quarter-inch faster.</p><p>She remembers what a pain in the pert old derri�re it was to repaint that glossy fender. It had been the first week of October, and the warm weather wouldn&#x2019;t quit. The old shed on Cape Cod stank of paint and grease, a peculiarly acrid reek that had crept right through the protective mask and into her sinuses and taken up residence, until she couldn&#x2019;t smell anything else, and she thought, <i>What the hell am I doing here? What the hell am I thinking?</i></p><p>Thank God that was all over. Thank God this rare inky-black 1936 Mercedes Special Roadster is now someone else&#x2019;s problem, someone willing to pay Pepper three hundred thousand dollars for the privilege of keeping its body and chrome intact against the ravages of time.</p><p>The deposit has already been paid, into a special account Pepper set up in her own name. (Her own name, her own money: now, that was a glorious feeling, like setting off for Europe on an ocean liner with nothing but open blue seas ahead.) The rest will be delivered today, to the Breakers hotel where Pepper is staying, in a special-delivery envelope. Another delightful little big check made out in Pepper&#x2019;s name. Taken together, those checks will solve all her problems. She&#x2019;ll have money for the baby, money to start everything over, money to ignore whoever needs ignoring, money to disappear if she needs to, forever and ever. She&#x2019;ll depend on no one. She can do whatever the hell she pleases, whatever suits Pepper Schuyler and&#x2014;by corollary&#x2014;Pepper Junior. She will toe nobody&#x2019;s line. She will fear nobody.</p><p>So the only question left in Pepper&#x2019;s mind, the only question that needs resolving, is the niggling Who?</p><p>Who the hell is this anonymous buyer&#x2014;a woman, Pepper&#x2019;s auction agent said&#x2014;who has the dough and the desire to lay claim to Pepper&#x2019;s very special Special Roadster, before it even reaches the public sales ring?</p><p>Not that Pepper cares who she is. Pepper just cares who she <i>isn&#x2019;t</i>. As long as this woman is a disinterested party, a person who has her own reasons for wanting this car, nothing to do with Pepper, nothing to do with the second half of the magic equation inside Pepper&#x2019;s belly, well, everything&#x2019;s just peachy keen, isn&#x2019;t it? Pepper will march off with her three hundred thousand dollars and never give the buyer another thought.</p><p>Pepper lifts a tanned arm and checks her watch. It&#x2019;s a gold Cartier, given to her by her father for her eighteenth birthday, perhaps as a subtle reminder to start arriving the hell on time, now that she was a grown-up. It didn&#x2019;t work. The party always starts when Pepper gets there, not before, so why should she care if she arrives late or early? Still, the watch has its uses. The watch tells her it&#x2019;s twenty-seven minutes past twelve o&#x2019;clock. They should be here any moment: Pepper&#x2019;s auction agent and the buyer, to inspect the car and complete the formalities. <i>If </i>they&#x2019;re on time, and why wouldn&#x2019;t they be? By all accounts, the lady&#x2019;s as eager to buy as Pepper is to sell.</p><p>Pepper tilts her head back and closes her eyes to the white sun. She can&#x2019;t get enough of it. This baby inside her must have sprung from another religion, one that worshipped the gods in the sky or gained nourishment from sunbeams. Pepper can almost feel the cells dividing in ecstasy as she points herself due upward. She can almost feel the seams strain along her green Lilly shift, the dancing monkeys stretch their arms to fit around the ambitious creature within.</p><p>Well, that makes sense, doesn&#x2019;t it? Like father, like child.</p><p>&#x201c;Good afternoon.&#x201d;</p><p>Pepper bolts upright. A small and slender woman stands before her, dark-haired, dressed in navy Capri pants and a white shirt, her delicate face hidden by a pair of large dark sunglasses. It&#x2019;s Audrey Hepburn, or else her well-groomed Florida cousin.</p><p>&#x201c;Good afternoon,&#x201d; Pepper says.</p><p>The woman holds out her hand. &#x201c;You must be Miss Schuyler. My name is Annabelle Dommerich. I&#x2019;m the buyer. Please, don&#x2019;t get up.&#x201d;</p><p>Pepper rises anyway and takes the woman&#x2019;s hand. Mrs. Dommerich stands only a few inches above five feet, and Pepper is a tall girl, but for some reason they seem to meet as equals.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised to see you,&#x201d; says Pepper. &#x201c;I had the impression you wanted to remain anonymous.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Dommerich shrugs. &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s just for the newspapers. Actually, I&#x2019;ve been hugely curious to meet you, Miss Schuyler. You&#x2019;re even more beautiful than your pictures. And look at you, blooming like a rose! When are you due?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;February.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always envied women like you. When I was pregnant, I looked like a beach ball with feet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was a long time ago.&#x201d; Mrs. Dommerich takes off her sunglasses to reveal a pair of large and chocolaty eyes. &#x201c;The car looks beautiful.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you. I had an expert helping me restore it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You restored it yourself?&#x201d; Both eyebrows rise, so elegant. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m impressed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There was nothing else to do.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Dommerich turns to gaze at the car, shielding her brows with one hand. &#x201c;And you found it in the shed on Cape Cod? Just like that, covered with dust? Untouched?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. My sister-in-law&#x2019;s house. It seemed to have been abandoned there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; says Mrs. Dommerich. &#x201c;It was.&#x201d;</p><p>The grass prickles Pepper&#x2019;s feet through the gaps in her sandals. Next to her, Mrs. Dommerich stands perfectly still, like she&#x2019;s posing for a portrait, <i>Woman Transfixed in a Crisp White Shirt</i>. She talks like an American, in easy sentences, but there&#x2019;s just the slightest mysterious tilt to her accent that suggests something imported, like the Chanel perfume that colors the air next to her skin. Though that skin is remarkably fresh, lit by a kind of iridescent pearl-like substance that most women spent fruitless dollars to achieve, Pepper guesses she must be in her forties, even her late forties. It&#x2019;s something about her expression and her carriage, something that makes Pepper feel like an ungainly young colt, dressed like a little girl. Even considering that matronly bump that interrupts the youthful line of her figure.</p><p>At the opposite end of the courtyard, a pair of sweating men appear, dressed in businesslike wool suits above a pair of perfectly matched potbellies, neat as basketballs. One of them spots the two women and raises his hand in what Pepper&#x2019;s always called a golf wave.</p><p>&#x201c;There they are,&#x201d; says Mrs. Dommerich. She turns back to Pepper and smiles. &#x201c;I do appreciate your taking such trouble to restore her so well. How does she run?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like a racehorse.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. I can almost hear that roar in my ears now. There&#x2019;s no other sound like it, is there?...</p></p><h2>Lady Slings the Booze</h2><p>Mike Callahan&#39;s wife, Lady Sally, runs an establishment where some unusual customers enjoy erotic entertainment and where a down-on-his-luck private detective gets a second chance. Reprint.</p><p>As the title of the second Lady Sally Callahan novel shows, Robinson ( Callahan's Lady ) has not lost his touch for puns. Unfortunately, he has lost his touch for character, plot and dialogue. This book is hilarious in places, but its disparate parts never merge as a whole. The story is disjointed, and there are long stretches where nothing relevant happens. Private detective Joe Quigley is hired to track down an invisible attacker at Lady Sally's brothel, and ends up saving the world from rabid pacifists who want to nuke it. In between, everyone makes love and makes puns. The characters are collections of eccentricities rather than real people. When they aren't busy punning and wisecracking, they are preaching at Quigley, whose main function is to be amazed at everything he sees. Near the end of the book the tone suddenly turns serious, and the change is jarring. Readers who feel a need to groan at Robinson's puns would be better off rereading his early Callahan collections (e.g., Callahan's Cross-Time Saloon ). <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Distant Mirror : The Calamitous Fourteenth Century</h2><p>The fourteenth century reflects two contradictory images: on the one hand, a glittering time of crusades and castles, cathedrals and chivalry, and the exquisitely decorated Books of Hours; and on the other, a time of ferocity and spiritual agony, a world of chaos and the plague. Barbara Tuchman reveals both the great rhythms of history and the grain and texture of domestic life as it was lived. Here are the guilty passions, loyalties and treacheries, political assassinations, sea battles and sieges, corruption in high places and a yearning for reform, satire and humor, sorcery and demonology, and lust and sadism on the stage. Here are proud cardinals, beggars, feminists, university scholars, grocers, bankers, mercenaries, mystics, lawyers and tax collectors, and, dominating all, the knight in his valor and &#34;furious follies,&#34; a &#34;terrible worm in an iron cocoon.&#34;</p><p>In this sweeping historical narrative, Barbara Tuchman writes of the cataclysmic 14th century, when the energies of medieval Europe were devoted to fighting internecine wars and warding off the plague. Some medieval thinkers viewed these disasters as divine punishment for mortal wrongs; others, more practically, viewed them as opportunities to accumulate wealth and power. One of the latter, whose life informs much of Tuchman&#39;s book, was the French nobleman Enguerrand de Coucy, who enjoyed the opulence and elegance of the courtly tradition while ruthlessly exploiting the peasants under his thrall. Tuchman looks into such events as the Hundred Years War, the collapse of the medieval church, and the rise of various heresies, pogroms, and other events that caused medieval Europeans to wonder what they had done to deserve such horrors.Anyone who has read THE GUNS OF AUGUST or STILWELL AND THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE IN CHINA, knows that Barbara Tuchman was one of the most gifted American writers of this century. Her subject was history, but her profiles of great men and great events are drawn with such power that reading Tuchman becomes a riveting experience<br><br>In A DISTANT MIRROR, Barbara Tuchman illuminates the Dark Ages. Her description of medieval daily life, the role of the church, the influence of the Great Plagues, and the social and political conventions that make this period of history so engrossing, are carefully woven into an integrated narrative that sweeps the reader along.<br><br> I am a particular devotee of medieval and pre Renaissance music, so Barbara Tuchman's brilliant analysis of this period has special meaning for me - and I hope for many others.<br><br>George Davidson, Director of Production, The Ballantine Publishing Group</p><h2>God&#39;s War: A New History of the Crusades</h2><p><p> <i>God's War</i> offers a sweeping new vision of one of history's most astounding events: the Crusades. </p><p> From 1096 to 1500, European Christians fought to recreate the Middle East, Muslim Spain, and the pagan Baltic in the image of their God. The Crusades are perhaps both the most familiar and most misunderstood phenomena of the medieval world, and here Christopher Tyerman seeks to recreate, from the ground up, the centuries of violence committed as an act of religious devotion. </p><p> The result is a stunning reinterpretation of the Crusades, revealed as both bloody political acts and a manifestation of a growing Christian communal identity. Tyerman uncovers a system of belief bound by aggression, paranoia, and wishful thinking, and a culture founded on war as an expression of worship, social discipline, and Christian charity. </p><p> This astonishing historical narrative is imbued with figures that have become legends--Saladin, Richard the Lionheart, Philip Augustus. But Tyerman also delves beyond these leaders to examine the thousands and thousands of Christian men--from Knights Templars to mercenaries to peasants--who, in the name of their Savior, abandoned their homes to conquer distant and alien lands, as well as the countless people who defended their soil and eventually turned these invaders back. With bold analysis, Tyerman explicates the contradictory mix of genuine piety, military ferocity, and plain greed that motivated generations of Crusaders. He also offers unique insight into the maturation of a militant Christianity that defined Europe's identity and that has forever influenced the cyclical antagonisms between the Christian and Muslim worlds. </p><p> Drawing on all of the most recent scholarship, and told with great verve and authority, <i>God's War</i> is the definitive account of a fascinating and horrifying story that continues to haunt our contemporary world. </p></p><p><b>Christopher Tyerman</b> is Lecturer in Medieval History at Hertford College and New College, University of Oxford.This is likely to replace Steven Runciman's 50-year-old <i>History of the Crusades</i> as the standard work.

(Dominic Sandbrook <i>Daily Telegraph</i> 2006-12-09)<br><br>With rekindled controversy about Western invasions of the Middle East, the Crusades of the late Middle Ages take on unanticipated relevance. It is thus a real boon for this strikingly effective book to appear at this time. The key to Tyerman's signal success is his ability to explain both the vicious brutality and the serious Christian altruism that were so intimately intertwined in the crusading experience and that have left such a tangled legacy for Muslim-Christian relations to this day. (Mark A. Noll <i>Christian Century</i> 2006-10-17)<br><br><i>God's War</i> is a long but highly readable account of this extensive back-and-forth struggle. It is an impressive achievement, a work that manages to tie together an extraordinary number of threads across nearly half a millennium of European history. Although it can be taken as a response to Pope Benedict XVI's comments at Regensburg, it is more properly read as an extended rejoinder to Steven Runciman's classic three-volume <i>History of the Crusades</i>, published in the early 1950s, a long and colorful account that is nonetheless studded with judgments that now seem prejudiced and amateurish. Tyerman, by contrast, is never amateurish. His knowledge of the period is encyclopedic, and his judgments are sharp, astute, and fair--which is to say unsparing--to both camps. He neither vilifies Islam nor engages in the easy Euro-bashing that is the obverse of Islamophobia. With so many people succumbing to subjectivism these days, it is bracing to come across a historian who remains resolutely above the fray, who insists on viewing the conflict as a whole and who always has the broader context in mind. (Daniel Lazare <i>The Nation</i> 2006-12-11)<br><br>Christopher Tyerman's <i>God's War</i> is comprehensive, fascinating, and timely. It deflates comparisons of current U.S. strategies with the Crusades. True, the participation of religious in battle (like Odo on the Bayeux Tapestry) is noteworthy, but so is Tyerman's questioning of the clich� 'Age of Faith.' Indeed, while these books make the Middle Ages seem real, they also make it seem different, and our capacity to entertain the differences is morally crucial. (Tom D'Evelyn <i>Providence Journal</i>)<br><br>Christopher Tyerman's <i>God's War: A New History of the Crusades</i> is a doorstop of a book, a mammoth effort to retell, based on modern scholarship, the story of how Western Christendom made war to wrest the Holy Lands from Muslim hands. As we all know, this isn't considered ancient history in the Middle East.

Just moments after four o&#x2019;clock, a large split of snow separates from Jubilee Mountain high above the tiny hamlet and hurtles down the rocky slope, enveloping everything in its path including nine young children who are walking home from school. But only four children survive. <i>Whiter Than Snow </i>takes you into the lives of each of these families: There&#x2019;s Lucy and Dolly Patch&#x2014;two sisters, long estranged by a shocking betrayal. Joe Cobb, Swandyke&#x2019;s only black resident, whose love for his daughter Jane forces him to flee Alabama. There&#x2019;s Grace Foote, who hides secrets and scandal that belies her genteel fa�ade. And Minder Evans, a civil war veteran who considers his cowardice his greatest sin. Finally, there&#x2019;s Essie Snowball, born Esther Schnable to conservative Jewish parents, but who now works as a prostitute and hides her child&#x2019;s parentage from all the world. <p></p>Ultimately, each story serves as an allegory to the greater theme of the novel by echoing that fate, chance, and perhaps even divine providence, are all woven into the fabric of everyday life. And it&#x2019;s through each character&#x2019;s defining moment in his or her past that the reader understands how each child has become its parent&#x2019;s purpose for living. In the end, it&#x2019;s a novel of forgiveness, redemption, survival, faith and family. <p></p></p><p>SANDRA DALLAS is the author of nine novels, including <i>Prayers for Sale</i>, <i>Tallgrass </i>and <i>New Mercies</i>. She is a former Denver bureau chief for <i>Business Week </i>magazine and lives in Denver, Colorado. <p></p>WHITER THAN SNOW (Chapter One) <p>No one knew what triggered the Swandyke avalanche that began at exactly 4:10 p.m. on April 20, 1920. It might have been the dynamite charge that was set off at the end of shift on the upper level of the Fourth of July Mine. The miners claimed the blast was too far inside the mountain to be felt on the surface, and besides, they had set off dynamite hundreds, maybe thousands, of times before, and nothing bad had happened. Except for that one time when a charge failed to go off and Howard Dolan hit it with his pick when he was mucking out the stope and blew himself and his partner to kingdom come.</p><p>Still, who knew how the old mountain took retribution for having its insides clawed out.</p><p>Certainly there was nothing to suggest that the day was different from any other. It started chill and clear. The men, their coat collars turned up against the dawn cold, left for their shifts at the Fourth of July or on the dredge up the Swan River, dinner pails clutched in their mittened hands. A little later, the children went off to school, the older brothers and sisters pulling little ones on sleds. Groups of boys threw snowballs at one another. One grabbed onto the back of a wagon and slid along over the icy road behind it. The Connor girl slipped on the ice and fell over a stone embankment, hitting her head. It hurt so much that she turned around and went home crying. The others called her a crybaby, but after what happened later that day, her parents said the blessed God had taken her hand.</p><p>After the children were gone, the women washed the breakfast dishes and started the beans for dinner. Then because the sun came out bright enough to burn your skin in the thin air, came out after one of the worst blizzards they had ever encountered, they got out the washtubs and scrubbed the overalls and shirts, the boys&#x2019; knickers and the girls&#x2019; dresses. When the wash was rinsed and wrung, they climbed onto the platforms that held the clotheslines far above the snow and hung up the clothes, where they would dry stiff as boards in the wind. Then because it was such a fine day, as fine a day as ever was, they called to one another to come and visit. There was a bit of coffee to reheat, and won&#x2019;t you have a cup? Cookies, left over from the lunch pails, were set on plates on the oilcloth of the kitchen tables, and the women sat, feeling lazy and gossipy.</p><p>&#x201c;You know, the Richards girl had her baby last week,&#x201d; announced a woman in one of the kitchens, taking down the good china cups for coffee.</p><p>&#x201c;Was her husband the father?&#x201d; asked her neighbor.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t have the nerve to ask.&#x201d;</p><p>In another house, a woman confided, &#x201c;The doctor says Albert has the cancer, but he won&#x2019;t have his lungs cut on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then he&#x2019;ll die,&#x201d; her friend replied, muttering to herself, &#x201c;at last.&#x201d;</p><p>It was that kind of a day, one for confidences or lazy talk. The women blessed the bright sun after so many winter days of gloom. Nobody thought about an avalanche. What could cause trouble on a day the Lord had given them?</p><p>Maybe the cause was an animal&#x2014;a deer or an elk or even a mountain sheep&#x2014;making its way along the ridge of Jubilee Mountain. The weight of the beast would have been enough to loosen the snow. That happened often enough. Nobody saw an animal, but then, who was looking?</p><p>Or worthless Dave Buck might have set off the avalanche. He&#x2019;d put on snowshoes and taken his gun and gone high up to hunt for a deer&#x2014;a fawn, really, for Dave was too lazy to cut up the bigger carcass and haul it home. The company forbade hunting around the mine, but Dave didn&#x2019;t care. He snowshoed up near timberline, where he&#x2019;d seen the footprints of deer. He didn&#x2019;t find any, and he stopped to drink from a pint he&#x2019;d put into his pocket. One drink, and another, and he sat down beside a stunted pine and picked off the cones and slid them down the white slope. Then he tossed the bottle into that cornice of snow that dipped out over a ridge.</p><p>But perhaps it was nothing more than the spring melt. That storm a few days before had dumped five feet of snowfall on top of a dry, heavy base of winter-worn snow. The wind had driven the snow off ridges, leaving them barren, and piled it into large cornices high up. But now the day was cloudless, the sun shining down as harsh as if it had been midsummer. It was so bright that it hurt your eyes to see the glare on the white, and some of the miners rubbed charcoal under their eyes to cut the sharpness.</p><p>But who cared what the cause was? Something started the slide that roared down Jubilee Mountain in Swandyke, Colorado, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>There was a sharp crack like the sound of distant thunder, and then the cornice of snow where Dave Buck had thrown his bottle, a crusted strip two hundred feet long that flared out over the mountain ridge, fractured and fell. It landed on layers of snow that covered the mountain slope to a depth of more than six feet&#x2014;a heavy, wet, melting mass of new snow on top, falling on frozen layers of snowpack that lay on a bed of crumbled ice. That bottommost layer, a mass of loose ice crystals formed by freezing and thawing, lubricated the acres of snow lying on top of it just as much as if the bed had been made of marbles, and sent the snow careening down the mountain.</p><p>The miners called such a phenomenon a &#x201c;slab avalanche&#x201d; because a curtain of snow slid down the slope, picking up speed at a terrible rate, until it reached one hundred miles an hour. Nothing stood in the way of the terrifying slide, because the mountainside was bare of trees. They had been torn out forty years earlier in the second wave of mining that came after the prospectors abandoned gold pans and sluice boxes. Men had trained giant hoses on the mountain, washing dirt down the slope to be processed for precious minerals. Hydraulic mining, as it was called, also rid the mountainside of rocks and trees and underbrush that would have interfered with an avalanche&#x2014;not that anything could have held back the tons of white that slid down Jubilee Mountain that afternoon. The slide would have taken anything in its path.</p><p>This was not the first slide on Jubilee Mountain. The hillside, in fact, was known for avalanches. But it was the worst, and it spilled over into the forest at the edge of the&nbsp;open slope, tearing out small trees by their roots and hurling them into the rushing snow, which turned them into battering rams. A cabin that perched under the pines was wrenched from its foundation, its log walls torn asunder and broken into jackstraws.</p><p>The slide rushed onward, churning up chunks of ice the size of boxcars, gathering up abandoned hoses and machinery and the other detritus of mining that lay in its path. It hurtled on, thrashing its deadly cargo about, not slowing when it reached the bottom of the mountain, but instead rushing across the road, filling the gully with snow as heavy as wet cement and flattening the willows. The avalanche hurtled on until it started up Turnbull Mountain. Then, at last, its momentum came to an end and the slide was exhausted, the front stopping first, the back end slipping down the mountain and filling the gulch with snow higher than a two-story house.</p><p>Snow hovered in the air like a deadly mist. The debris caught up in the avalanche rolled a little and was still. A jack pine, graceful as a sled, glided to a stop in the snow covering the road. Clumps of snow fell from the trees still standing at the edge of the deadly white mass, making plopping sounds as they landed. Snowballs broke loose and rolled down the hill, leaving little trails in their wake.</p><p>For an instant, all was quiet, as silent as if the slide had occurred in a primeval forest. Then a high-pitched scream came from somewhere in the mass of snow, a child&#x2019;s scream. The slide thundered down Jubilee Mountain just after the grade school let out, and it grabbed up nine of thirty-two schoolchildren in its icy grip. Five of the victims were related, the children of the Patch sisters&#x2014;Dolly&#x2019;s three, who were Jack, Carrie, and Lucia, along with Lucy&#x2019;s two, Rosemary and Charlie. The slide was no respecter of class, because it took Schuyler Foote, son of the manager of the Fourth of July Mine, and little Jane Cobb, the Negro girl, whose father labored in the mill, and Sophie Schnable, the daughter of a prostitute. And then there was Emmett Carter, that near-orphan boy who lived with his grandfather. All of them were swept up and carried along in that immense swirl of white.</p><p>Four of the children survived.</p><p>WHITER THAN SNOW Copyright � 2010 by Sandra Dallas.</p></p><h2>Meaning In Western Architecture</h2><p>Surveys the ways in which man has symbolized his search for order in his environment through architecture in such cultures as ancient Egypt and modern America</p><p>Text: English, Italian (translation)</p><h2>The Beast Under the Wizard&#39;s Bridge</h2><p>Lewis Barnavelt tries to avert disaster when the destruction of an old bridge threatens to release a diabolical force, the legacy of a long-dead evil magician.

Lewis's guardian, Uncle Jonathan (a sorcerer), and their neighbor Mrs. Zimmermann ("an honest-to-goodness witch") also know that the bridge is evil. In overhearing a conversation between them, Lewis mistakenly concludes that Jonathan does not trust him or Rose Rita, bringing back his old fears of being sent away from the family and friends he has come to love. In fact, Uncle Jonathan distrusts Mephistopheles and Ermine Moote, who are attempting to help bring back The Great Old Ones. If they succeed, the earth will be their dominion and humans will cease to exist. In the end, Lewis and Rose Rita (with a little help from Uncle Jonathan and Mrs. Zimmermann) are able to stop the Mootes and save the world. Lewis learns that his fears of losing his home are unfounded, and his relationship with his uncle is strengthened.

In <i>Arms Wide Open,</i> a prequel to that acclaimed book, Patsy tells the story of growing up during one of the most turbulent times in America and becoming an idealistic home-birth midwife.<br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing heavily on her journals, Patsy reaches back to tell us how she first learned to deliver babies, and digs even deeper down to tell us of her youthful experiments in living a fully sustainable and natural life. In the 1960s and &#x2019;70s, she spent over a decade with her first partner living in rural areas in Minnesota and Ohio before eventually purchasing a farm with Tom Harman in West Virginia.<br> &nbsp;<br> Patsy recounts the hardships and the freedom of living in the wilds of Minnesota in a log cabin she and her lover built with their own hands, the only running water hauled from nearby streams. She describes long treks in the snow with her infant son strapped to her chest, setting up beehives for honey, and giving chase to a thieving bear. Eventually, yearning for more connection, Patsy moves into communal life, forming alliances with the eco-minded and antiwar counterculture that was both loved and reviled in those days.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a young mother on the commune, Patsy offers her personal experience and assistance to other women who, like her, wish to have safe, natural births. In time, she becomes a self-taught midwife, delivering babies in cabins and on farms, sometimes in harrowing circumstances. But her passion for the work drives her to want to help more, to do more. And so she begins the professional training that will fully accredit her to assist in childbirth. In a final section, Patsy takes us into the present day, facing the challenges of running a women&#x2019;s health clinic with her husband, mothering adult sons, and holding true to their principles and passions in the twenty-first century<br> &nbsp;<br> More than a personal memoir, <i>Arms Wide Open</i> paints a portrait of a generation&#x2019;s desperate struggle to realize their ideals as they battled against the elements and against the conservative society that labeled them &#x201c;hippies&#x201d; and belittled their ecological and pacifist beliefs. Her memoir is a beautiful recollection of the convictions of the baby boom generation, a riveting account of surviving in the wild, and a triumphant story of living responsibly in our over-consuming society.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br>&nbsp;</p><p><b>PATRICIA HARMAN, </b>CNM, has published in the<i> Journal of Midwifery and Women&#x2019;s Health</i> and <i>Journal of Sigma Theta Tau for Nursing Scholarship</i> as well as in alternative publications.

Harman lives and works near Morgantown, West Virginia, and has three sons.<br>&nbsp;<b>Prelude </b><br><br>All the way down Route 119, past Gandeeville, Snake Hollow, and Wolf Run, I&#x2019;m thinking about the baby that died.<br> &nbsp;<br> I wasn&#x2019;t there, didn&#x2019;t even know the family. It happened a few days ago, with another midwife, at a homebirth in Hardy County, on summer solstice, the longest day of the year.<br> &nbsp;<br> Word on the informal West Virginia midwives&#x2019; hotline is that the baby&#x2019;s shoulders got stuck, a grave emergency. The midwife, Jade, tried everything, all the maneuvers she&#x2019;d studied in textbooks and the special tricks she&#x2019;d learned from other practitioners, but nothing worked. They rushed, by ambulance, to the nearest hospital thirty miles away, with the baby&#x2019;s blue head sticking out of the mother, but it was too late. Of course it was too late.<br> &nbsp;<br> Homebirth midwives in West Virginia are legal, but just barely, and there&#x2019;s no doubt the state coroner&#x2019;s office will investigate. Jade is afraid.<br> &nbsp;<br> We are all afraid.<br> &nbsp;<br> We whip around another corner and I lose my supper out the side window. <i>Who do I think I am taking on this kind of responsibility? Why am I risking my life to get to a homebirth of people I hardly know? What am I doing in this Ford station wagon being whipped back and forth as we careen through the night?</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> I awake sick with grief, my heart pounding. I&#x2019;m lying on a pillow-padded king-size bed with floral sheets. A man I hardly recognize sleeps next to me. This is Tom, I remind myself: my husband of thirty-three years, a person whose body and mind are as familiar to me as my own. I prop myself up on an elbow, inspecting his broad shoulders, smooth face, straight nose and full lips, his short silver hair, in the silver moonlight. One hairy leg sticks out of the covers. One arm, with the wide hand and sensitive surgeon&#x2019;s fingers, circles his pillow. It&#x2019;s 3:45, summer solstice morning.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I rise and pull on my long white terry robe, I stand for a moment, getting my bearings, then open the bedroom door that squeaks and pad across the carpeted living room. Outside the tall corner windows, the trees dance in the dark. Once I called myself Trillium Stone. That was my pen name when I lived in rural communes, wrote for our political rag, <i>The Wild Currents</i>, taught the first natural-childbirth classes, and started doing homebirths.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now I&#x2019;m a nurse-midwife with short graying hair, who no longer delivers babies, living with an ob-gyn in this lakefront home, so far from where I ever thought I would live, so far from where I ever <i>wanted </i>to live. I search the photographs on the piano of my three handsome sons, now men. Do I wake? Do I sleep?<br> &nbsp;<br> OK, my life has been a wild ride, I&#x2019;ll admit it, but the image of this hippie chick lurching through the night, on her way to a homebirth, with only a thick copy of <i>Varney&#x2019;s Midwifery </i>as a guide, disturbs me. What did she think she was doing? Where did she get the balls?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> On the highest shelf in the back of our clothes closet, a stack of journals gathers dust. For seventeen years I carried them in a backpack from commune to commune. They&#x2019;ve moved with me across the country three times, through midwifery school, Tom&#x2019;s medical school and his ob-gyn residency. I can&#x2019;t get the diaries out of my mind, a mute witness to my life . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> I slip back through the bedroom. Tom snores on. By the dim closet light, I find a stepladder and struggle to bring down the shabby container. The journals have been closed for twenty-five years; pages stick together and smell faintly of mold.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m on a mission now, trying to understand, but I&#x2019;m surprised to find that I started each entry with only the day and the month, no year. This is going to take a while. It seems I never expected anyone would want to reconstruct my life, not even me. I&#x2019;m an archaeologist digging through my own past.<br> &nbsp;<br> With narrowed eyes, I flip through notebook after notebook, daring that flower child to show her face. When the alarm goes off, Tom, dressed in blue scrubs for the OR, finds me asleep in the white canvas chair, with a red journal open, over my heart.</p><h2>The RKO Story</h2><p>Surveys the history of the motion picture studio, RKO Radio Pictures, from its beginnings in 1928 to its collapse in 1960 and discusses a variety of its films</p><p></p><h2>William Marshall: The Flower of Chivalry</h2><p>Recreates in detail the life of this advisor to the Plantagnets and knight extraordinaire.</p><p>&#34;A small masterpiece of its genre...Duby has reconstructed a living picture of a particular sector of society at a crucial moment, at the brink of a great change...He presents his picture of the fascinating and eventful life of the Marshal, and of the world in which he lived, [with] vividness...intimacy, and...historical perception.&#34; --The New York Review of BooksGeorges Duby, one of this century&#39;s great medieval historians, has brought to life with exceptional brilliance and imagination William Marshal, adviser to the Plantagents, knight extraordinaire, the flower of chivalry.

Yet for the final, fateful months of their journey, the systematic imaging of this extraordinary scientific endeavor was left to Scott himself, trained by Ponting. In the face of extreme climactic conditions and technical challenges at the dawn of photography, Scott achieved an iconic series of images; breathtaking polar panoramas, geographical and geological formations, and action photographs of the explorers and their animals, remarkable for their technical mastery as well as for their poignancy. Lost, fought over, neglected and finally resurrected, Scott's final photographs are here collected, accurately attributed and catalogued for the first time: a new dimension to the last great expedition of the Heroic Age and a humbling testament to the men whose graves still lie unmarked in the vastness of the Great Alone. <br><br></p><p>David M. Wilson, a highly respected polar historian who regularly lectures on exploration history, is a great nephew of Dr. Edward Wilson, who died with Captain Scott and his party.

What would cause a talented student from a wealthy family to shoot himself in front of a promenading public? Decadence and boredom, it is presumed. But young sleuth Erast Fandorin is not satisfied with the conclusion that this death is an open-and-shut case, nor with the preliminary detective work the precinct has done&#x2013;and for good reason: The bizarre and tragic suicide is soon connected to a clear case of murder, witnessed firsthand by Fandorin himself. Relying on his keen intuition, the eager detective plunges into an investigation that leads him across Europe, landing him at the center of a vast conspiracy with the deadliest of implications.</p><p>&#x201c;Mystery readers should enjoy this story.

His analyses and interventions reported here are dazzling: part science and part intuition, his portrayals of his clients are drawn with an artist's eye for detail. We observe him ferret out the roles family members lock themselves into as they interact in his office; we follow his thinking as he tests hypotheses and observes the effects of his interventions. A family's pain, he shows, may not lie in the apparent cause--the depressed father or the hyperactive child--but in the way all members relate. Including his own family history, Minuchin describes his approach so lucidly that readers will take a new look at their own families. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Genes, Mind, and Culture: The Coevolutionary Process</h2><p>Analyzes the reciprocative relationship between genes in individuals and the production of culture and shows how predictions about genetic evolution within a cultural pattern can be made</p><p><b>Edward O.

Shvets reveals here everything but that man's real name. The informant taught at Harvard, worked for Carter, hated Reagan, moved in Dukakis circles, and was hard-pressed for cash--a vulnerable target for the KGB in the mid-1980s. It was Shvets' task to identify and reel in such malcontents in the American capital, where the KGB officer posed as a TASS journalist. Imbued with professional pride in the guile and blandishments he used to identify and persuade "Socrates" to cooperate, Shvets, nevertheless, is contemptuous about the value of human intelligence. In his view, it was worthless except as currency in KGB office and career politics, but his position against spying is contradicted by the case of "Bill." "Bill" was a star agent, all the more spectacular because he was a lowly janitor, but one who cleaned the DC offices of defense contractors. Shvets claims that "Bill" supplied 50 percent of all technical intelligence collected by the KGB in 1982--rather a vindication than condemnation of secret intelligence gathering. The world's second-oldest profession is not apt to go away because of Shvets' criticisms, revelatory as they are about the infighting and incompetence in his department of the KGB. Rather, interest in espionage may increase with his regalements of the cloak-and-dagger methods for defeating surveillance and the recruiting and running of these two agents. Since "Socrates" is under FBI investigation, libraries can back-up breaking news with this intriguing memoir of intrigue. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Guilty by Reason of Insanity: Inside the Minds of Killers</h2><p>A psychiatrist and an internationally recognized expert on violence, Dorothy Otnow Lewis has spent the last quarter century studying the minds of killers. Among the notorious murderers she has examined are Ted Bundy, Arthur Shawcross, and Mark David Chapman, the man who shot John Lennon. Now she shares her groundbreaking discoveries--and the chilling encounters that led to them.<br><br>From a juvenile court in Connecticut to the psychiatric wards of New York City's Bellevue Hospital, from maximum security prisons to the corridors of death row, Lewis and her colleague, the eminent neurologist Jonathan Pincus, search to understand the origins of violence. GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY is an utterly absorbing odyssey that will forever change the way you think about crime, punishment, and the law itself.</p><p>"We met no Jimmy Cagneys or Robert Mitchums among the inmates in the prisons we visited. We found ourselves, rather, in the company of a pathetic crew of intellectually limited, dysfunctional, half-mad, occasionally explosive losers. Long before these men wound up on death row, their similarly limited, primitive, impulsive parents had raised them in the only fashion they knew.... These brutish parents had set the stage on which our condemned subjects now found themselves playing out the final act. It was a drama generations in the making." <p> Psychiatrist Dorothy Otnow Lewis, working in a professional partnership with neurologist Jonathan Pincus, has been steadily accumulating and publishing (in medical journals) evidence that almost all vicious criminals have some combination of (1) a childhood of abuse and/or neglect, (2) brain injuries through accident or abuse, and (3) psychotic symptoms, especially paranoia. This fascinating and well-written book, aimed at a wide audience, takes the form of a memoir in which Lewis tells us about the events that led her to study violent patients and about some of her more interesting cases, especially those on death row. Far from being another shallow "oh wow" book about conversations with horrifying killers, this is a thoughtful, humane examination of the horrible experiences that most murderers have endured, and a penetrating analysis of how subtle signs of brain damage in these people have been missed by other researchers. Lewis has an engagingly humble and personal way of writing about her experiences, which makes her findings all the more credible. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>"COMPELLING."<br>--Christopher Lehmann-Haupt<br> The New York Times<p>"RIVETING . . .

She is a former lawyer turned writer and is the mother of one son. She lives in the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii with her husband.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>1992</p><p>The day Vivi Ann had been waiting for&#x2014;January 25&#x2014; seemed to take forever to arrive. When it finally came, she woke even earlier than usual. Long before dawn had lightened the night sky, she threw back the covers and got out of bed. In the cold darkness of her room, she dressed in insulated coveralls and a woolen cap. Grabbing a pair of worn leather work gloves, she stepped into big rubber boots and went outside.</p><p>Technically she didn&#x2019;t have to feed the horses. Her latest ranch hand would do it. But since she was too excited to sleep, she figured she might as well do something useful.</p><p>Without a moon to guide her, she couldn&#x2019;t see anything except a ghostly silvered image of her own breath, but if therewas one thing Vivi Ann knew in this world, it was the lay of her father&#x2019;s land.</p><p>Water&#x2019;s Edge.</p><p>More than one hundred years ago, her great- grandfather had homesteaded this property and founded the nearby town of Oyster Shores. Other men had chosen easier, more populated areas, places with easier access, but not Abelard Grey. He had crossed the dangerous plains to get here, lost one son to an Indian raid and another to influenza, but still he&#x2019;d moved West, lured by a dream to this wild, secluded corner of the Evergreen State. The land he chose, one hundred and twenty- five acres tucked between the warm blue waters of the Hood Canal and a forested hillside, was spectacularly beautiful.</p><p>She walked up the small rise toward the barn they&#x2019;d built ten years ago. Beneath a high, timbered ceiling, a large riding arena was outlined by four- rail fencing; twelve box stalls flanked the east and west sides of the structure. After she opened the huge sliding door, the overhead lights came on with a sound like snapping fingers, and the horses instantly became restless, whinnying to let her know they were hungry. For the next hour, she separated flakes of hay from the bales stacked in the loafing shed, piled them into the rusted wheelbarrow, and moved down the uneven cement aisles. At the last stall, a custom- made wooden sign identified her mare by her rarely used registered name: Clementine&#x2019;s Blue Ribbon.</p><p>"Hey, girl," she said, unbolting the wooden door and sliding it sideways.</p><p>Clem nickered softly and moved toward her, sneaking a bite of hay from the wheelbarrow.</p><p>Vivi Ann tossed the two flakes into the iron feeding rack and closed the door behind her. While Clem ate, Vivi Ann stood beside her, stroking the big mare&#x2019;s silky neck.</p><p>"Are you ready for the rodeo, girl?"</p><p>The mare nuzzled her side as if in answer, almost knocking Vivi Ann off her feet.</p><p>In the years since Mom&#x2019;s death, Vivi Ann and Clementine had become inseparable. For a while there, when Dad had quit speaking and started drinking, and Winona and Aurora had been busy with high school, Vivi Ann had spent most of her time with this horse. Sometimes, when the grief and emptiness had been too much for Vivi Ann to handle, she&#x2019;d slipped out of her bedroom and run to the barn, where she&#x2019;d fall asleep in the cedar shavings at Clem&#x2019;s hooves. Even after Vivi Ann had gotten older and become popular, she&#x2019;d still considered this mare her best friend. The deepest of her secrets had been shared only here, in the sweet- smelling confines of the last box stall on the east aisle.</p><p>She patted Clem&#x2019;s neck one last time and left the barn. By the time she reached the house, the sun was a smear of butterscotch-yellow light in the charcoal- gray winter sky. From this vantage point, she could see the steel-gray waters of the Canal and the jagged, snow-covered peaks of the distant mountains.</p><p>When she stepped into the shadowy farm house, she could hear the telltale creaking of floorboards and knew her father was up. She went into the kitchen, set three places at the table and then started breakfast. Just as she put a plate of pancakes into the oven to warm, she heard him come into the dining room. Pouring him a cup of coffee, doctoring it with sugar, she took it to him.</p><p>He took it from her without looking up from his Western Horseman magazine.</p><p>She stood there a moment, wondering what she could say that would start a conversation.</p><p>Dressed in his usual work clothes&#x2014;well- worn Wrangler jeans and a plaid flannel shirt, with a saucer- sized silver belt buckle and leather gloves tucked in his waistband&#x2014;he looked like he did every morning. And yet there was something different, too: a subtle collection of lines or wrinkles that aged his face.</p><p>The years since Mom&#x2019;s death had been unkind to him, sharpening his features and adding shadows where none belonged, both in his eyes and in the fleshy bags beneath. His spine had curved; it was the mark of a farrier, he said, the natural result of a lifetime spent hammering nails into horses&#x2019; hooves, but loss had played a part in that curving of his spine, too. Vivi Ann was certain of it. The weight of an unexpected loneliness had reshaped him as surely as the hours he&#x2019;d spent hunched at work. The only time he really stood tall anymore was when he was in public, and she knew how much it pained him to appear unbowed by his life.</p><p>He sat down at the table and read his magazine while Vivi Ann readied and served breakfast.</p><p>"Clem&#x2019;s made some awesome practice runs this month," she said, taking her place across from him. "I really think we have a chance of winning the rodeo in Texas."</p><p>"Where&#x2019;s the toast?"</p><p>"I made pancakes."</p><p>"Fried eggs need toast. You know that."</p><p>"Mix them in with the hash browns. We&#x2019;re out of bread."</p><p>Dad sighed heavily, obviously irritated. He looked pointedly at the empty place setting on the table. "You seen Travis this morning?"</p><p>Vivi Ann glanced through the window toward the barn. There was no sign of their ranch hand anywhere. No tractor out and running, no wheelbarrow by the barn door. "I fed the horses already. He&#x2019;s probably out fixing that fence."</p><p>"You picked another winner with that one. If you&#x2019;d quit res-cuin&#x2019; every hurt horse between here and Yelm, we wouldn&#x2019;t need no help around here at all. And the truth is we can&#x2019;t afford it."</p><p>"Speaking of money, Dad . . . I need three hundred bucks for the rodeo this week and the coffee can is empty."</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t respond.</p><p>"Dad?"</p><p>"I had to use that money to pay the hay bill."</p><p>"It&#x2019;s gone?"</p><p>"The tax bill just came, too."</p><p>"So we&#x2019;re in trouble," Vivi Ann said, frowning. She&#x2019;d heard it before, of course, had always known there wasn&#x2019;t much money, but for the first time, it really hit home. She understood suddenly why Winona was always harping about saving money for taxes. She cast an upward glance at her dad. He sat hunched forward, with his elbows on the table. Her sisters would have seen that as rude; Vivi Ann was sure she knew better. "Your back hurting you again?"</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t answer, didn&#x2019;t even acknowledge the question.</p><p>She got up, went into the kitchen, and got him some ibuprofen, setting the pills gently on the table between them.</p><p>His splayed farrier&#x2019;s hand closed over them.</p><p>"I&#x2019;ll find a way to get the money, Dad. And I&#x2019;ll win this week. Maybe as much as two thousand bucks. Don&#x2019;t you worry."</p><p>They finished the rest of the meal in silence, with him reading his magazine. When he was done, he pushed back from the table and stood up. Reaching for the sweat- stained brown felt cowboy hat that hung on a hook by the door, he said, "Make me proud."</p><p>"I will. &#x2019;Bye, Dad."</p><p>After he left, Vivi Ann sat there, feeling unsettled.</p><p>For most of her twenty- four years she&#x2019;d been like a leaf on the water, just floating along, following what ever current came her way. She&#x2019;d tried changing direction a few times, but every attempt (like community college) had ended quickly, with her returning to this land.</p><p>She loved it here, plain and simple. She loved being around the horses, training them, and passing her expertise on to the bright- eyed girls who idolized her riding ability. She loved that everyone in town knew who she was and respected her and her family. She even loved the weather. Lots of folks complained about the gray days that followed each other, one after another, from November to April, but she didn&#x2019;t mind at all. No rain, no rainbows. That was her motto, and had been since she was twelve years old, a girl standing beside a freshly dug grave, trying to make sense of an incomprehensible loss. Then, she&#x2019;d told herself that life was short and having fun was what mattered.</p><p>Now, though, it was time for her to grow up. Water&#x2019;s Edge needed her for once, instead of the other way around. She wasn&#x2019;t sure exactly how to make a change. Business and planning were hardly her strong suits, but she was smarter than people gave her credit for being. All she had to do was think about it.</p><p>But first she needed to borrow three hundred dollars from one of her sisters.</p><p>She&#x2019;d tell them it would be a good investment.</p><p>Winona liked running the show. Any show; every show. And not from the sidelines, either. In college, all it had taken was one constitutional law class, and she&#x2019;d glimpsed her future. Now, at twenty- seven, she had her life pretty much as she wanted it. Not completely, of course (she was unmarried, not dating, childless, and struggling with her weight), but pretty much. She was far and away the most successful attorney in Oyster Shores. It was common knowledge that she was fair, opinionated, and smart. Everyone said she was a good person to have on your side. Winona valued her reputation almost as much as she did her education. Dad and Vivi Ann might worship at the altar of their land, but Winona had a broader religion. For her, it was the community that mattered and the people who lived here. It was okay that Vivi Ann was the beautiful heart of town; Winona strove to be it...</p></p><h2>Refresh Your Garden Design with Color, Texture and Form</h2><p>Maybe your garden isn't what it once was. &nbsp;Or maybe it's stunning during the full bloom of summer, but falls apart the rest of the year. &nbsp;Maybe it's crowded, sparse or it just doesn't resonate with you, and you have no idea why or what to do about it. &nbsp;Don't despair! &nbsp;Acclaimed garden designer and best-selling author Rebecca Sweet offers simple strategies for transforming blah spaces into breathtaking places.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Garden transformations don't always require an expensive overhaul by a team of professionals.

According to this time-honored system, successful art is based on balanced energies and the control of contrasting elements within a work. This remarkably simple approach is presented in two seamless parts. Part One examines the traditional elements of painting-from value (light/dark) and texture (thick/thin) to color (warm/cold) and brushwork (sharp/blurred)-as evolving from a true balance of opposites. Part Two&#39;s step-by-step demonstrations focus on major genres of painting-still life, landscape, and the figure-employing all the yin-yang principles for the completion of successful paintings.</p><p>Hongnian Zhang is an award-winning artist from China.

Both he and his co-author Lois Woolley, a professional portrait painter, are on the faculty of the Woodstock School of Art in their hometown of Woodstock, New York, where they share their lives and a studio.Several books have recently been published applying ancient Eastern philosophy to painting, including Jeanne Carbonetti's The Tao of Watercolor (Watson-Guptill, 1998), which was very successful. The Chinese philosophy of yin and yang comprises a natural framework for creating art. With yin and yang, the world and in this case the world within a painting is seen in terms of the balance of opposites. Positive forces require negative forces, and energy is released by their balance. In this book, traditional elements of painting are related to yin/yang pairs, e.g., value relates to dark/light, composition to up/down, left/right, front/back, and big/little, color intensity to soft/strong, and so forth. Using a variety of styles and subject matter, the two painter/authors make a very convincing case for using yin and yang as a guiding principal and as a way of inspiring balanced yet highly energetic work. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tony Bennett in the Studio: A Life of Art &amp; Music</h2><p><b>Every one of Tony&#x2019;s millions of devoted fans will treasure this definitive volume.</b>Tony Bennett, the world&#x2019;s most beloved living legend, has a talent that&#x2019;s simply timeless. He&#x2019;s the smooth and subtle singer of the classic American songbook, the recipient of countless Grammy� awards and nominations, an Emmy Award�, and a Kennedy Center Honoree. The Library of Congress bestowed a Living Legend Award on him in 2000, the National Endowment for the Arts named him a Jazz Master in January of 2006, and he just received Billboard magazine&#x2019;s prestigious Century Award for his outstanding contributions to music. Contemporary singers such as Bono, Sting, Diana Krall, John Legend, and the Dixie Chicks idolize him. Recently, Bennett turned 80 and he has celebrated this milestone with the same joie de vivre with which he celebrates life in general; he&#x2019;s at the height of his popularity, thanks to the bestselling album <i>Duets</i> and a brilliantly conceived TV special directed by Rob Marshall, director of the Academy Award�-winning Chicago. When performing as Tony Bennett, he connects to people everywhere through the magic of his music. What many of his admirers may not know, however, is that Bennett, under the name of Anthony Benedetto, is also a successful painter whose works hang in major museums and galleries, including the Smithsonian.<br>In this beautiful new book, richly illustrated with his own artwork, Tony takes the time to reflect on his career, and the inspiration that continues to infuse both his music and his art. Along with journalist Robert Sullivan, he explores recurring themes in his life, including jazz, individualism, the creative zone, love, truth and beauty, chiaroscuro (the balance of light and shadow, both in painting and life), and the lifelong adventure that has taken him around the world and back again. His own personal memorabilia will be on display, along with album covers and notes. And for everyone who loves Bennett&#x2019;s gorgeous voice and elegant song stylings: an exclusive CD featuring his favorite tunes, including some rare choices.</p><p>At 80, still a popular performer and recording artist, Bennett continues to explore new ideas in his art. Rather than write a traditional biography, interviewer Sullivan (<i>Remembering Sinatra</i>) decided to focus on presenting the Bennett perspective on life, framed by over 200 of Bennett's paintings and sketches. When Bennett recalls Cary Grant advising him not to go into acting, his elegant painting of Grant emphasizes their mutual admiration. A discussion of aboriginal art's similarities to music is illustrated by Bennett's painting of James Moody with an aborigine-type background. His portrait sketches alone form a kind of visual history of American jazz and the people who influenced it. A CD of Bennett pop classics is also tucked in, including But Beautiful, The Very Thought of You and four other hits. Readers needing a fuller account of Bennett's life may prefer his autobiography, <i>The Good Life</i>, but to get a feeling for his visual styles, music and totally upbeat attitude to life, this volume is perfect. 200 color illus. not seen by <i>PW</i>. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With 24/7 access to nearly all of the world's information at our fingertips, we no longer trek to the library or the encyclopedia shelf in search of answers. We just open our browsers, type in a few keywords and wait for the information to come to us. Indeed, the Internet has revolutionized the way we learn and know, as well as how we interact with each other. And yet this explosion of technological innovation has also produced a curious paradox: even as we know more, we seem to understand less.</p><p>While a wealth of literature has been devoted to life with the Internet, the deep <em>philosophical</em> implications of this seismic shift have not been properly explored until now. Demonstrating that knowledge based on reason plays an essential role in society and that there is much more to &#x201c;knowing&#x201d; than just acquiring information, leading philosopher Michael Patrick Lynch shows how our digital way of life makes us overvalue some ways of processing information over others, and thus risks distorting what it means to be human.</p><p>With far-reaching implications, Lynch's argument charts a path from Plato's cave to Shannon's mathematical theory of information to Google Glass, illustrating that technology itself isn't the problem, nor is it the solution. Instead, it will be the way in which we adapt our minds to these new tools that will ultimately decide whether or not the "Internet of Things"&#x2015;all those gadgets on our wrists, in our pockets and on our laps&#x2015;will be a net gain for humanity. Along the way, Lynch uses a philosopher's lens to examine some of the most urgent issues facing digital life today, including how social media is revolutionizing the way we think about privacy; why a greater reliance on Wikipedia and Google doesn't necessarily make knowledge "more democratic"; and the perils of using "big data" alone to predict cultural trends.</p><p>Promising to modernize our understanding of what it means to be human in the digital age, <em>The Internet of Us</em> builds on previous works by Nicholas Carr, James Gleick and Jaron Lanier to give us a necessary guide on how to navigate the philosophical quagmire that is the Information Age.</p></p><p>Michael P.

We all know in theory what we should do to be good. The problem is that in practice, we forget. And we forget because the modern secular world always thinks that it is enough to tell someone something once (be good, remember the poor etc.) But all religions disagree here: they insist that if anyone is to stand a chance of remembering anything, they need reminders on a daily, perhaps even hourly basis.<p></p> <strong>Q:</strong> What do you think of the aggressive atheism we have seen in the past few years?<p></p> <strong>A:</strong> I am an atheist, but a gentle one. I don't feel the need to mock anyone who believes. I really disagree with the hard tone of some atheists who approach religion like a silly fairy tale. I am deeply respectful of religion, but I believe none of its supernatural aspects. So my position is perhaps unusual: I am at once very respectful and completely impious.<p></p> <strong>Q:</strong> Are you nostalgic for the deeply religious past?<p></p> <strong>A:</strong> Like many people, of course I feel nostalgic. How is it possible not to feel nostalgic when you look at 15th frescoes or the rituals of an ancient carnival? However, we have to ask: how should I respond to my nostalgia? My thought is that we can use it creatively, as the basis for a rebirth, for the creation of new things, for the creation of things that later generations will feel nostalgic about... So it frustrates me when people say things like, 'Well, they knew how to build in the 15th century, now it is impossible...' Why! Anything is possible. We should not sigh nostalgically over religion, we should learn from them. We should steal from them.<p></p> <p> <strong>Q:</strong> If we were to replace religion with a secular equivalent, who would be our gurus?</p> <p> <strong>A:</strong> We don't need a central structure. We are beyond the age of gurus and inspirational leaders. We are in the age of the Wiki structure. This means that it is up to all of us to look at religion and see what bits we can steal and place into the modern world. We might all contribute to the construction of new temples, not the government, but the concerned, interested individual. The salvation of the individual soul remains a serious problem--even when we dismiss the idea of God. In the 20th century, capitalism has really solved (in the rich West) the material problems of a significant portion of mankind. But the spiritual needs are still in chaos, with religion ceasing to answer the need. This is why I wrote my book, to show that there remains a new way: a way of filling the modern world with so many important lessons from religion, and yet not needing to return to any kind of occult spirituality.</p> <strong>Q:</strong> Don't you think that, in order to truly appreciate religious music and art, you have to be a believer--or, at least, don't you think that non-believers miss something important in the experience?<p></p> <strong>A:</strong> I am interested in the modern claim that we have now found a way to replace religion: with art. You often hear people say, 'Museums are our new churches'. It's a nice idea, but it's not true, and it's principally not true because of the way that museums are laid out and present art. They prevent anyone from having an emotional relationship with the works on display. They encourage an academic interest, but prevent a more didactic and therapeutic kind of contact. I recommend in my book that even if we don't believe, we learn to use art (even secular art) as a resource for comfort, identification, guidance and edification, very much what religions do with art.Alain de Botton is the author of Essays in Love, The Romantic Movement, Kiss and Tell, How Proust Can Change Your Life, The Consolations of Philosophy, The Art of Travel, Status Anxiety, The Architecture of Happiness, The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work, A Week at the Airport, Religion for Atheists, The News: A User&#39;s Manual, and latest novel The Course of Love, among many others.

The grandmotherly Louhi is a shape changer, at home knitting socks, comfortable as an eagle snatching the Earth's light. (Children who watch He-Man after school will readily accept this mixture of the heroic and the homey.) The story is nevertheless disappointing. The strong motivation and strong personalities of the epic are much diminished. Louhi steals the sun and moon casually, looking for "some Witch-Witch-Witchety things to do." The bard Vainamoinen is powerless to set things to right. Seppo, the smith, blusters more than actually shows his power. However, Cooney's provocative illustrationsmixed media, predominately acrylicswill carry most children beyond all this. A perfect winter stillness hangs in her snow pictures. The terrible darkness in her landscapes in which light no longer shines is a powerful reminder of the story's origin in Finland's national epic. Yet, if the artist in the reader is satisfied, the storyteller wishes for more.

Martin</strong><br><br> <strong></strong><p><strong> Q:</strong> It's been a decade since the last Baby-sitters Club books came out, and 24 years since the first book was published. What was it like to come back to the BSC after so many years away?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong> I had a great time re-visiting the characters. It was fun to explore their lives in the prequel, &#x201c;"The Summer Before," and to figure out what led the girls to form The Baby-sitters Club, something that would eventually change their lives. It was like a reunion with friends--friends who haven&#x2019;t changed a bit. <br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Kristy, Claudia, Mary Anne, and Stacey are very different characters, which is in part why the series was and is still so popular. Every reader can relate to at least one of the characters. So, we have to ask you--which character are you most like?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong> I am most like Mary Anne who is the shy and quiet one. Like me, Mary Anne enjoys more solitary pursuits such as reading and needlework. My favorite character, however, is Kristy. I think she's my alter ego.<br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Were you allowed to baby-sit when you were twelve? If so, were they any funny or awful stories you'd like to share? <br><br> <strong>Martin: </strong> Yes, I did a lot of baby-sitting when I was twelve. One of the worst and also funniest things that ever happened was when I was baby-sitting for our neighbors and the kids wanted to wash their parents' car. They started the job with much enthusiasm--using Brillo pads. <br><br><strong>Q:</strong> More than 200 BSC books were published in the eighties and nineties. Are there any that you are particularly fond of and why?<br><br> <strong>Martin: </strong> My favorite Baby-sitters Club book is "Kristy's Great Idea," which is the first book and sets the series in motion. I also like the more serious books such as "Claudia and the Sad Good-bye," which deals with the death of Claudia&#x2019;s grandmother. This book was written shortly after my own grandmother died. My other favorite BSC books include &#x201c;Kristy and the Secret of Susan,&#x201d; in which the members of the BSC baby-sit for a child with autism, and "Jessi's Secret Language" in which the girls learn American Sign Language in order to communicate with a sitting charge with profound hearing impairment.<br><br> <strong>Q: </strong>Why do you think that the series is so well-loved and has endured over so many years? <br><br><strong>Martin:</strong> I think the characters in the BSC books are easily relatable. The books deal with timeless topics including friendship, family, and school.&nbsp; Also, the books tackle serious issues including racism, bullying, kids with disabilities (physical and mental), and death of a loved one. These issues were relevant to kids in the 1980s and 1990s, and are still relevant to kids today. In addition to being relatable, these are characters readers can aspire to. The kids run a business--in this case, a baby-sitting business. They are entrepreneurial, independent, creative, and confident. And at the heart of the series is the friendship--the "glue" that binds these characters. Sure, they have fights, but they're loyal and they support one another. I think a lot of us--even adults--can relate to that. <br><br> <strong>Q: </strong>"The Summer Before" takes place during the summer before the girls enter the seventh grade--where suddenly there's a ton of pressure to fit in. The months leading up to it can be filled with anxiety, excitement, and anticipation. Do you remember how you spent the summer before seventh grade? <br><br><strong>Martin:</strong> I was nervous that summer because in the fall I would be going to a new school &#x2013; the junior high (this was in the time before middle schools). Even the words "junior high" seemed terribly grown-up. My friends and I would be attending school with eighth-graders, who were one step away from high school. I spent that summer reading, going to the community pool, taking a family trip to Cape May, New Jersey, doing some baby-sitting, and also recovering from surgery. But the knowledge that I would soon be in junior high school colored every day and every activity and did lend the summer an air of both anxiety and anticipation.<br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Despite the fun the girls have together in "The Summer Before," they're all dealing with pretty tough problems&#x2014;moving away, an absentee father, a first crush. How did you choose the issues you wanted to focus on?<br><br> <strong>Martin:&nbsp;</strong> One of my favorite things about writing a series was that the characters themselves generated plot ideas for later books. One of the themes that developed as the series progressed was that of Kristy's relationship with her father. It was an idea I enjoyed exploring, and when I had the opportunity to write the prequel I realized that this summer would be a charged time for Kristy, and that I could introduce the issues she had with her father here; then they could unfold in the later books. The same applied to Stacey. Her reasons for moving to Stoneybrook had been revealed in later books, but I realized that during this particular summer the reader could actually watch the events take place. The other issues &#x2013; a first crush, wanting more independence yet still feeling like a kid--are themes that I felt would resonate with most "tween" readers.<br><strong><br> Q: </strong>Even though the books have been out of print for ten years there are still some very devoted fans. Surely you must have received a ton of letters about the series over the years. Are there any that stick out in your mind?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong> The most memorable are stories of girls who have written to me and told me that I&#x2019;ve made an impact on their lives, that The Baby-sitters Club books have turned them into readers. Some have also said that the BSC books made them aspire to become writers. I&#x2019;ve also heard from a lot of the original fans who grew up to become teachers, librarians, editors, journalists, entrepreneurs, etc. To know that this series inspired a generation of readers and writers is very humbling. <br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> There&#x2019;s been a lot of speculation in the blogosphere about where Claudia, Kristy, Mary Ann, and Stacey would be now, in 2010, had they grown up. Do you have any thoughts on what path each would have taken?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong>&nbsp; I understand the fascination of the older BSC fans who would like to know what happened with the characters when they got older. It&#x2019;s thrilling to realize that after all these years the fans remain passionate about the books and the characters in The Baby-sitters Club. I can see Kristy running a business--I can also see her being in politics. I think Mary Anne became a teacher. I imagine Stacey went into fashion--not as a designer, but maybe on the business side. And Claudia became an artist. I think fans can fill in for the rest of the characters!<br><br> </p>Ann M.

They headed north, holding a sign that read ALASKA OR BUST! They arrived in Cordova nearly broke, found work together in a local cannery, and, in a month, managed to save twelve hundred dollars. They bought a twenty-foot boat for exactly that amount. They lived on it, fished off of it, and used a bucket for a toilet.It was a romantic, albeit bare-bones, beginning in the rugged little fishing village located in a wind, sprawling land bursting with boomtown opportunity and colorful characters. There was a local stripper namedTequilla, whose writhing style of dancing naked was known to cause almost a riot as lonely, affection-starved fishermen trampled one another for a closer look.Then there was Machine Gun Betty. She was a large Indian woman who worked as a bartender at a local watering hole. Her way of dealing with a rowdy crowd of drunken fishermen (who refused to leave at quitting time) was to pull out a Thompson submachine gun, level it on her rambunctious patrons, and order them off the premises. "It's closing time! Get the hell out!" she'd say as the bar emptied.During those eight years of hard work as a commercial fisherman, Skip Holden had seen some sights--such as the time the Fish and Game Department opened the season up in the fjord near Coghill Point, and he and his fishing pals had netted one million sockeye salmon in a single week of red-hot fishing.Named after Skip's wife, the F/V <i>Marlene</i> was known in fishing circles as a Snowball bow-picker. She had a six-foot-high reel mounted in the center of her foredeck. This spool-like contraption was designed to feed the one-thousand-foot-long gillnet off her bow and reel it back aboard via the same route.Along the way, Skip had learned a few things about the nature of successful fishermen, too. Foremost, he had learned not to try to be like anybody else: The best fishermen fished according to the dictates of their own personalities.As a rule, Holden worked alone. More of a hunter-type person himself, he liked to motor past the main sandbars (where most of his more conservative fellow gillnetters chose to make their "drifts") and out through the surf. He enjoyed fishing the deep waters of the open ocean. When possible, he liked to intercept the fish well before they reached the main branch of the river, something at which he was quite adept, now having the self-assurance of a seasoned fisherman, one who had paid his dues and acquired a fair amount of fishing savvy along the way.Armed with little more than a compass and a Fathometer, he roamed as far as ten miles out from the wild and ever-changing sixty-mile-wide delta of sandbars and tidelands known as the Copper RiverFlats, fishing the salmon-rich waters as far out as Cape Hinchinbrook.Some fishermen didn't like the stress of making "sets," laying out their gillnets and fishing out in the open ocean. They generally fished the inside waters. They didn't seem to mind fighting the crowds, or having to pull their gillnets back aboard every few minutes, then run back up the line, lay them out again, and start from scratch. By contrast, Skip Holden liked to fish the deep, outside waters. He liked the sight of free, open spaces and uncluttered horizons. He'd been raised that way. When he was a boy, sailing off the California coast, his father had taught him the art of navigation, as well as how to keep a ship in good repair and how to tie the rope knots that were essential to life at sea. Most important, his father instilled in his son the belief that shallow water is a fisherman's worst enemy.It was the going out and coming back in over the sandbars at entrance channels, especially those at Softuk, and Strawberry, and Egg Island, that local fishermen feared most. Let an out-rushing tide confront a strong flow of onshore wind, and the waves can really stack up.Even for Skip Holden, getting trapped out on the open sea in a sudden blow was something to be avoided if at all possible. Let him receive a warning over the local CB fishing channel announcing that the sandbar was closing, and Holden would rush his net aboard and make a mad scramble in over the building breakers before they closed him out. Once inside the punishing surf line, he would wait out the storm in the shelter of one of the tideland coves carved out of tens of miles of sandbars by the thirteen-foot tides that flooded in over the area several times each day.Miss the closing, get cut off by a sudden storm, and a fisherman would have few options, all of them dangerous. Left unprotected by island or berm, caught tens of miles from Cordova, a fisherman could either jog into the storm and weather (which might last for several days and nights) or make the near-impossible journey around the thirty-mile length of Hinchinbrook Island, running broadside to the storm winds and waves crashing ashore the entire way. Lose an engine, throw a prop, and you would be history.Regardless, Holden was always hanging it out there, working on theedge. Unlike some wanna-be fishermen, however, Holden had the touch. And during the season, it wasn't unusual for him to intercept as much as four thousand dollars' worth of the migrating fish in a single week.On that gray day in 1981, Holden had already gone for two days and nights without sleep, standing anchor watch, waiting out the past few days of blustery weather in a featureless, godforsaken reach inside Softuk Bar. It was no big deal, really. Gillnetting the flats had always been a young man's sport. And Holden could go for days without sleep. But when the winds finally did calm down, he thought, That's it. Time to go fishing, and, pulling anchor, he fled out across the bar.Once at sea, however, Holden soon found himself idling up the high, sloping faces of the unusually large swells lumbering in toward shore. Enormous as they were, the swells weren't breaking, and he drifted over them one by one, the bulging waters passing smoothly underneath him. It was the air around him, however, that spooked him. The enveloping air had turned "eerie calm, like out of breath," as he put it. It was a little like entering into the eye of a hurricane. Skip Holden had never experienced anything quite like it.Shortly, the sky grew dark, and as the unexpected storm intensified, strong winds burst up the scene. Blowing directly in against the outrushing tide, the winds soon whipped the sea into a cresting frenzy. In only minutes, thunderous breakers began collapsing across the entire width of the bar, effectively closing off any possible retreat.Still, Holden was determined to give it a try, and so he maneuvered into the roiling waters of the bar. He had managed to weave his way past several rows of breakers, when, in the gray-black of the dim evening light, he spotted a single white lightbulb mounted atop the mast of another salmon boat. Having learned of Holden's plight, a fellow fisherman had apparently left the safety of his snug anchorage and was now motoring back and forth just inside the breakers, trying to guide Holden into the deeper waters of the main channel, through at least five thousand feet of breaking waves and lathering foam.Maybe I can make it through this, thought Holden, focusing on the challenge at hand. Now, should I go around this breaker and throughthat one? he asked himself as he pushed ahead. Is it deeper there? What's my Fathometer reading? Uh-oh--too shallow. I'll try this way.Finally conceding defeat, Holden fought his way back out through the marching rows of breakers, then began motoring down the sixty-mile delta of sandbars and bordering channels.When he arrived at the channel leading past Egg Island, he found stiff seventy-mile-per-hour winds driving heavy seas ashore, and the bar closed. Without one of the powerful VHF radios on board with which to call out, he was forced to rely on the comparatively feeble power of his CB radio."Hey, Phil, what's happening?" he radioed his good friend Phil Thum. "Is there a way in? Do you see any way in there?""No, I don't think you can get in, Holden. It's breaking all the way across the bar here."The entire time he talked, Holden was jogging along the outside edge of the sandbar at the Egg Island entrance, quickly looking for an opening in the surf. Either I find my way in past Egg Island here, he thought, or I'll be out here all night. It's now or never. He cruised up and down the bar, but was unable to find anything like an opening."I really don't see any way in there," Holden radioed Thum finally."There is no way in," cut in the anonymous voice of another fisherman.And suddenly, all cross-chatter on his CB radio ceased, followed by a dead silence. Holden caught the full measure of what this meant. Everyone listening knew that there was no way back, and that in the building seas, the trip out and around Hinchinbrook Island would be pure suicide. His only hope would be to try to jog into the storm, however long it might last, however severe it might be.Well, this will be good for a laugh with my buddies back at the Reluctant Fisherman saloon in Cordova, he thought. Old Holden thought he could beat Mother Nature, and he got his butt kicked."Boy, I'm sure glad I'm safe and sound and anchored up in here," bragged another fisherman over the CB, laying it on thick."I sure wouldn't want to be out there in this kind of weather," remarked another in a tone of sincere empathy.Sometimes, Holden knew, a fisherman could find a place where he could kind of surf in where the waves weren't actually breaking. But the winds were gusting past eighty miles an hour now, and as the dark, peculiar cloud cover pressed down on him, Holden continued to motor back and forth along the outside edge of the breaking surf, praying all the while for a freak opening through which he and his boat might pass.It was then that the steering on his boat went out."Damn!" he said aloud.Suddenly caught dead in the water, Holden knew that he was in serious trouble. The winds seemed determined to blow him broadside into the Hawaiian-sized breakers now folding over and exploding with boat-crushing furor all along the mouth of the bar.He refused to let the instinct to panic have its way. Somehow, in the breaking seas and wild, punishing winds, Holden searched for a way to stabilize his boat. Like any seasoned fisherman, he knew the score: Lose the boat, lose your life.Then, cleverly, he hit upon the solution. He would play out three-quarters of his one-thousand-foot-long gillnet and, if the tide was right, catch a ride on the tidal currents as they flowed offshore and away from the breakers, all the while using the net (with the departing waters pushing against it) as a kind of sea anchor.He fed the 750-foot trail of webbing and buoys off his bow roller and watched as the offshore flow caught it. He was in luck. The tide was going out. The net, buoys, and ship were being swept out to sea and away from the pounding surf. The vessel's bow swung to point into the accelerating storm winds, exactly as he had hoped.Holden tied the net off on the ship's bow cleats to prevent the six-foot-high, four-foot-wide aluminum reel from being torn from its steel deck mounts and jerked overboard.As the darkness closed in, Holden found it difficult to see anything clearly. His eyes strained toward something in the distance. He stood squinting in the dim light, peering through the haze of rain and blowing spray. He couldn't be certain. The misty vision was either one ofbreakers demolishing themselves on nearby rocks or the flash of the buoy marker over on Wessels Reef."Holden, how are you doing out there?" radioed Phil Thum, who was anchored off in a wind-raked channel amid the barren sands of Egg Island. "Do you want me to call the Coast Guard?""Well, Phil, I'm still alive here," replied Holden. "If a Coast Guard rescue basket were to somehow land on my deck, I'd climb right in. But there's just no way a helicopter could make it out here. It's too damned windy."As the night progressed, the storm intensified and the wind pushed the waves higher. In the gathering darkness, the winds were soon hissing across the water at ninety miles per hour, with stronger gusts ranging out of wave valleys large enough to hold a football field, complete with goalposts.Getting trapped on the outside in such a blow in a relatively tiny boat (26 feet compared to one of the weather-busting king-crab boats, some of which are 150 feet long and 40 feet wide) was one of the worst experiences a Prince William Sound salmon fisherman could have.Holden was hoping that the driving wind and torrential rains would soon blow themselves out. What he could not have known was that one of the most formidable storms in the history of storm-ravaged Prince William Sound had pushed into the area, catching him flat-footed and leaving him cut off, with nowhere to run. In addition to the wicked winds, more rain would fall on the area of the Copper River Flats over the next three days in the shortest amount of time ever recorded, some fourteen inches in all.Skip Holden opened the door leading into the tiny space of his wheelhouse and quickly stepped inside. He was still dripping wet when the F/V <i>Marlene</i>'s main engine coughed heavily. Holden bent over, removed one section of the floorboard, and peered down into the small engine compartment. It was not an encouraging sight. The bilge area was full of water, which was now lapping at the sides of the gas engine.Then Holden recalled how he'd been running along with his back door left open slightly to flush out all engine fumes from inside hiscabin. Seawater, he surmised, had silently and surreptitiously been seeping in through the opening since the storm had first kicked up. The engine's carburetor and wiring were getting drenched. I need to get busy now and bail some water out of here, he told himself. I've got to shut down this engine and very methodically remove the seawater from the bilge. One thing at a time.Holden slammed the back door and tied it shut, securing the handle with a length of rope. With the engine turned off, he knew that the bilge would soon run the battery down to the point where it could no longer turn the engine over. Then all hope of somehow getting the carburetor dried out and the engine started would be lost. Holden tore away the remaining floorboards, leapt down into the chest-deep engine compartment, and immediately went to work bailing out the water. When, more than a hour later, he looked up again from his sweaty efforts, the compartment was relatively free of seawater, while outside, the dull gray evening had given way to a coal black void of blasting winds and pummeling rain.Normally, ...</p><h2>Sophie&#39;s World : A Novel About the History of Philosophy</h2><p>Sophie finds two questions in her mailbox: &#34;Who are you?&#34; and &#34;Where does the world come from?&#34; This is the start of her journey through the history of philosophy, guided by a mysterious mentor.

Unlike their European counterparts, who specialized in visions of heaven, "American preachers are constantly referring to the earth, and it is only with great difficulty that they can divert their attention from it." More than a century later, J.F. Powers built an entire career on this national tendency. And nowhere did he capture the sacred-and-profane balancing act with more amusement than in his 1975 novel, <i>Wheat That Springeth Green</i>. His protagonist, a Great Depression-era child of the Midwest named Joe Hackett, has early dreams of joining the priesthood: <blockquote> If he decided to be a priest in a religious order, though, he could live out in the country, at a college, and have invigorating walks and talks with students ... and maybe some exciting adventures, and also do good, as often happened in the Father Finn books ("'My God!' cried the atheist") that Sister Agatha read to the class at the end of the day. </blockquote> Joe eventually attends seminary, is ordained, and finds himself appointed as assistant to a high-octane contemplative, Father Van Slaag. But by the time he gets his own parish, in 1968, he's become an expert at relegating sanctity to the back burner. Overweight, agreeably resigned, Joe accepts the fact that "running a parish, any parish, was like riding a cattle car in the wintertime--you could appreciate the warmth of your dear, dumb friends, but you never knew when you'd be stepped on, or worse."<p> It takes the arrival of a young, over-earnest curate to jog his idealism back to life. And in return, he imparts to the younger man his knowledge of the "worldly" priesthood--a craft that Powers, no less than de Tocqueville, refuses to condemn. This exchange, which is gradual and grudging on both sides, occupies the greater portion of <i>Wheat That Springeth Green</i>. And the protagonist's regeneration, like that alluded to in the title, seems no less miraculous for being expected. The result is a marvelous, acute novel, which gives to Joe's spiritual rebirth the shape of a classic American comedy--trials and tribulations, and finally, a happy ending. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>J.

This early-20th-century battle centers on one man: Tom Anderson, the undisputed czar of the city's Storyville vice district, who fights desperately to keep his empire intact as it faces onslaughts from all sides. Surrounding him are the stories of flamboyant prostitutes, crusading moral reformers, dissolute jazzmen, ruthless Mafiosi, venal politicians, and one extremely violent serial killer, all battling for primacy in a wild and wicked city unlike any other in the world.</p><p><b>GARY KRIST&nbsp;</b>has written for the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>Esquire</i>,&nbsp;<i>Salon</i>, the&nbsp;<i>Washington Post</i>&nbsp;Book World, and elsewhere. He is the author of the bestselling&nbsp;<i>City of Scoundrels</i>&nbsp;and the acclaimed&nbsp;<i>The White Cascade</i>, as well as several works of fiction. He has been the recipient of the Stephen Crane Award, the Sue Kaufman Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a Lowell Thomas Gold Medal for Travel Journalism, and a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts.It was, in many respects, the most brutal assault so far: a two-year-old child killed instantly by a single blow to the skull; her critically injured parents rendered senseless by multiple head traumas. Clotted gore soaked the bed where they all lay. Across the walls and curtains around them, blood spatters radiated like birdshot. And yet, despite this evidence of what must have been a savage frenzy of violence, no one in the neighborhood had heard a thing. The perpetrator had been able to escape without a single witness to the crime, and with hours to spare before his deed was detected. The axman was apparently becoming even more adept at his trade with time.<br>&nbsp;<br>The crime had been discovered at about seven o&#x2019;clock on a Sunday morning. Several neighbors had made earlier visits to the grocery, which usually opened at five a.m., and had merely walked away when they found it closed. But one little girl named Hazel Johnson was more persistent. After getting no response at the front door, she decided to try around back. In the alley leading to the rear of the building, she found a chair set up below a side window. She climbed up on the chair and peered inside, but couldn&#x2019;t see anything in the murky morning light. So she continued down the alley to the backyard. There she found the back door closed, but with one of its lower panels missing. Puzzled, she called a passerby into the yard, and he persuaded her to go inside, perhaps because she was small enough to fit through the missing panel. She crawled in&#x2014;and moments later burst out the back door, screaming.<br>&nbsp;<br>Aroused by this clamor, a young neighbor named Frank Jordano ran over with his aging father, Iorlando. They found Charles Cortimiglia half-conscious on the floor, and Rose Cortimiglia clutching her lifeless toddler and sobbing inarticulately. Her husband, Charles, roused out of his stupor by the younger Jordano, sat up on the floor. &#x201c;Frank,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m dying. Go for my brother-in-law.&#x201d; It was the last thing he would say for several days.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since the town of Gretna was in Lafayette Parish, Peter Leson, chief of the Gretna police, and Lafayette sheriff Louis Marrero would conduct the investigation of the Cortimiglia case, with Superintendent Mooney&#x2019;s force merely assisting from afar. What Leson and Marrero found at the scene, however, indicated that the crime was clearly related to the previous year&#x2019;s cases across the river. The axman&#x2019;s signature modus operandi was obvious&#x2014;from chiseled door panel to rummaged belongings, with little sign of anything of value actually being taken. This time, a box containing money and jewelry was found undisturbed in the bedroom, along with $129 in cash hidden under the Cortimiglias&#x2019; mattress. But two trunks and a dresser had been practically torn apart in some kind of frenzied search; even the face of the mantelpiece clock had been pried open and examined. As in the other axman cases, however, no fingerprints were found anywhere, and any footprints in the yard had unfortunately been trampled by the curious crowd of neighbors that had gathered at the scene after hearing Hazel Johnson&#x2019;s screams.<br>&nbsp;<br>The discovery of two axes on the premises&#x2014;one bloody and obviously the murder weapon, another covered with fresh mud&#x2014;led Leson to believe that two men might have been responsible for this attack. Perhaps one had stood on the chair in the alley to keep an eye on the victims&#x2014;and simultaneously on the street&#x2014;while his partner worked on the back-door panel to gain entrance. This two-perpetrator idea could even illuminate one nagging aspect of the earlier attacks. Having an accomplice could explain how the axman was so successful at eluding detection, even while chiseling away at a back door&#x2014;an activity that must have been noisy enough to be heard by anyone lying awake in bed or passing on the street. In other words, the axman may not have had wings (as the impressionable Bruno girl had speculated), but he could have had a second set of eyes&#x2014;keeping a lookout while he performed his grim duties inside.<br>&nbsp;<br>But Leson and Marrero were not interested in solving the earlier crimes; they were concerned only with the one in their own jurisdiction, and they pursued their investigation with an aggressive single-mindedness that they would later come to regret. While interviewing the Cortimiglias&#x2019; neighbors, they gleaned hints that the Jordanos might not be the Good Samaritans they at first had seemed. According to the neighbors, the two families had been feuding for some time, ever since the Cortimiglias had taken over the languishing Jordano grocery in 1916 and turned it into a success. The Jordanos had taken back the business just a few months ago, forcing the Cortimiglias to find a shop elsewhere in Gretna. But recently the Cortimiglias had come back, setting up a brand-new grocery on the lot adjoining that of the Jordano store. And now, just two weeks later, the Cortimiglias were lying near death after being brutally attacked in the night. When asked about the situation, the Jordanos insisted that they had made peace with the Cortimiglias and were now good friends, but Marrero had his doubts.<br>&nbsp;<br>Back on the other side of the river, Superintendent Mooney continued to insist that all of the ax attacks (except, perhaps, for the Harriet Lowe murder) had been committed by a &#x201c;degenerate madman,&#x201d; and that &#x201c;he ransacked the places he enters to create the impression that robbery is his motive.&#x201d; The superintendent&#x2019;s desk was now covered with maps, police reports, and photos of all of the ax cases in the city, and he was reportedly poring over them night and day. According to the <i>Times-Picayune,</i> his collection also included &#x201c;the opinions of some of the South&#x2019;s best recognized scientists, placing the axman in the same class as Catherine de&#x2019; Medici, the French author Sade, and other historic degenerates.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>But the Gretna authorities had a far more mundane perpetrator in mind for the Cortimiglia attack. So sure were they of Frank Jordano&#x2019;s guilt that they kept asking the Cortimiglias again and again whether he was the man who assaulted them. The victims were still barely coherent and could do little more than nod or whisper in reply. But while Charles Cortimiglia (by some accounts) continued to insist that he did not recognize his assailant, his twenty-one-year-old, highly traumatized wife apparently indicated an affirmative to the question. This was enough for Chief Leson.<br>&nbsp;<br>He promptly had the younger Jordano arrested, despite the fact that the Cortimiglias&#x2019; doctor refused to &#x201c;vouch for the condition of their minds.&#x201d; &#x201c;Both Charlie Cortimiglia and his wife, Rosie, told me that Frank Jordano had committed the crime,&#x201d; Leson told a skeptical press. &#x201c;We have worked up a strong case against him and I am satisfied that the circumstances surrounding the case justified the arrest.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Frank Mooney ignored these developments in Gretna, preferring to pursue his own theory of the murders. In a high-profile presentation to the press&#x2014;including, as a visual aid, a large city map marked with no fewer than sixteen alleged axman incidents&#x2014;the superintendent outlined what he was now calling his &#x201c;panel theory.&#x201d; There were common elements, he claimed, not just in the various ax assaults, but also in the numerous attempted ax break-ins that had been reported throughout the city over the past year. And these common elements convinced him that the crimes were all the work of a single man.<br>&nbsp;<br>The <i>Times-Picayune </i>reprinted the commonalities in full:<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Location</i>&#x2014; In nearly all of the cases a corner house with a high board fence at the side and rear has been selected, and in most instances it was a grocery or barroom or a combination of both.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Time</i>&#x2014;The hour generally has been about 3 AM.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Method</i>&#x2014;Entrance has been effected by removing a lower panel of a rear door. The plan of work in each instance has been remarkably similar.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Weapon</i>&#x2014;Where the crimes proceeded to the attack, an ax has been used (except in one case where a hatchet was wielded)&#x2014;sometimes an ax found on the premises, sometimes brought by the murderer, but always an old ax and always left behind.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>The attack</i>&#x2014;Always on sleeping victims with no apparent choice between men and women, and use of the blade of the weapon as a rule.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Precautions</i>&#x2014;Complete failure to find fingerprints, together with the fact a pair of rubber gloves was left behind in one case, leads to the belief that the murderer uses rubber gloves to protect himself against identification by the fingerprint method.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Robbery as a Camouflage</i>&#x2014;In practically every ax murder, while bureaus, safes, and cabinets have been ransacked, little was stolen, and money and valuables in plain sight were left behind. And in numerous instances of &#x201c;panel burglaries,&#x201d; the work of the intruder has been so incomplete as to leave strong doubt whether robbery was the real motive.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mooney did acknowledge that each assault and break-in could conceivably be a separate, unrelated incident. He also admitted that they all might be part of a systematic campaign of revenge or terrorism by the Mafia or Black Hand. But he remained convinced that the culprit in all or most of the incidents was a &#x201c;solo maniac&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;a diabolical, bloodthirsty fiend, cunning and shrewd,&#x201d; as the <i>Times-Picayune</i> described him, &#x201c;a slinking agent of the devil at 3 AM.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Then, on Sunday, March 16, the city received a kind of confirmation of this macabre description. The <i>Times-Picayune </i>reprinted a remarkable document the paper had received in the mail on Friday. It was an open letter to the public purporting to be from the axman himself. Addressed to the newspaper&#x2019;s editor, and written in a hand similar to that of the letters received by Superintendent Mooney from the anonymous criminologist, it began with an attention-getting flourish: &#x201c;Esteemed Mortal: They have never caught me and they never will. They have never seen me, for I am invisible, even as the ether which surrounds your earth. I am not a human being, but a spirit and a fell demon from hottest hell. I am what you Orleanians and your foolish police called the axman.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The letter went on to ridicule the police for their inept investigation of his crimes. The department&#x2019;s antics had been so &#x201c;utterly stupid,&#x201d; in fact, that they had amused not only him, but also &#x201c;His Satanic Majesty&#x201d; and the recently deceased emperor of Austria, Franz Joseph, among other denizens of hell. &#x201c;Undoubtedly you Orleanians think of me as a most horrible murderer, which I am,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;but I could be much worse if I wanted to. If I wished to, I could pay a visit to your city every night. At will I could slay thousands of your best citizens, for I am in close relationship with the Angel of Death.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The letter writer followed this with a threat, specifying the time of his next appearance: &#x201c;Now, to be exact, at 12:15 o&#x2019;clock (earthly time) on next Tuesday night, I am going to pass over New Orleans.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>But those in fear of their lives had one way to protect themselves:<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I am very fond of jazz,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;and I swear by all the devils in the nether regions that every person shall be spared in whose house a jazz band is in full swing at the time I just mentioned. If everyone has a jazz band going, well, then so much the better for the people. One thing is certain, and that is [that] some of those persons who do not jazz it on Tuesday night (if there be any) will get the ax.&#x201d; The letter was signed, simply: &#x201c;The Axman.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The sensation created by this letter&#x2014;particularly in the poorer ethnic neighborhoods that had been hardest hit by the ax crimes&#x2014;can only be imagined. Certainly many, if not most, people in the city must have doubted the authenticity of the document. There was something too slick&#x2014;too ironic and knowing&#x2014;about the entire exercise to be fully convincing as the ramblings of a crazed maniac. But for a populace traumatized by a bizarre and brutal crime wave, the letter was a shock, hoax or no hoax. After all, <i>something </i>was stalking the streets at night with malicious intent. And if the way to appease the demon was to cut loose for a night, then New Orleans, starved of music and conviviality by the forces of reform, would cut loose with abandon.</p><h2>Claire of the Sea Light</h2><p><p>From the best-selling author of <i>Brother, I&#x2019;m Dying</i> and <i>The Dew Breaker:</i> a stunning new work of fiction that brings us deep into the intertwined lives of a small seaside town where a little girl, the daughter of a fisherman, has gone missing.<br><br> Claire Limy� Lanm�&#x2014;Claire of the Sea Light&#x2014;is an enchanting child born into love and tragedy in Ville Rose, Haiti.

She lives in Miami.<br></p>Part One<br> Claire of the Sea Light <br> &nbsp;<br> The morning Claire Limy� Lanm� Faustin turned seven, a freak wave, measuring between ten and twelve feet high, was seen in the ocean outside of Ville Rose. Claire&#x2019;s father, Nozias, a fisherman, was one of many who saw it in the distance as he walked toward his sloop. He first heard a low rumbling, like that of distant thunder, then saw a wall of water rise from the depths of the ocean, a giant blue-green tongue, trying, it seemed, to lick a pink sky.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just as quickly as it had swelled, the wave cracked. Its barrel collapsed, pummeling a cutter called <i>Fifine</i>, sinking it and Caleb, the sole fisherman onboard.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nozias ran to the edge of the water, wading in to where the tide reached his knees. Lost now was a good friend, whom Nozias had greeted for years as they walked past each other, before dawn, on their way out to sea.<br> &nbsp;<br> A dozen or so other fishermen were already standing next to Nozias. He looked down the beach at Caleb&#x2019;s shack, where Caleb&#x2019;s wife, Fifine&#x2014;Josephine&#x2014;had probably returned to bed after seeing him off. Nozias knew from his experience, and could sense it in his bones, that both Caleb and the boat were gone. They might wash up in a day or two, or more likely they never would.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a sweltering Saturday morning in the first week of May. Nozias had slept in longer than usual, contemplating the impossible decision he&#x2019;d always known that he would one day have to make: to whom, finally, to give his daughter.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Woke up earlier and I would have been there,&#x201d; he ran back home and tearfully told his little girl.<br> &nbsp;<br> Claire was still lying on a cot in their single-room shack. The back of her thin nightdress was soaked with sweat. She wrapped her long, molasses-colored arms around Nozias&#x2019;s neck, just as she had when she was even littler, pressing her nose against his cheek. Some years before, Nozias had told her what had happened on her first day on earth, that giving birth to her, her mother had died. So her birthday was also a day of death, and the freak wave and the dead fisherman proved that it had never ceased to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> The day Claire Limy� Lanm� turned six was also the day Ville Rose&#x2019;s undertaker, Albert Vincent, was inaugurated as the new mayor. He kept both positions, leading to all kinds of jokes about the town eventually becoming a cemetery so he could get more clients. Albert was a man of unmatched elegance, even though he had shaky hands. He wore a beige two-piece suit every day, just as he did on the day of his inauguration. His eyes, people said, had not always been the lavender color that they were now. Their clouding, sad but gorgeous, was owing to the sun and early-onset cataracts. On the day of his swearing-in, Albert, shaking hands and all, recited from memory a speech about the town&#x2019;s history. He did this from the top step of the town hall, a white nineteenth century gingerbread that overlooked a flamboyant-filled piazza, where hundreds of residents stood elbow to elbow in the afternoon sun.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ville Rose was home to about eleven thousand people, five percent of them wealthy or comfortable. The rest were poor, some dirt-poor. Many were out of work, but some were farmers or fishermen (some both) or seasonal sugarcane workers. Twenty miles south of the capital and crammed between a stretch of the most unpredictable waters of the Caribbean Sea and an eroded Haitian mountain range, the town had a flower-shaped perimeter that, from the mountains, looked like the unfurling petals of a massive tropical rose, so the major road connecting the town to the sea became the stem and was called Avenue Pied Rose or Stem Rose Avenue, with its many alleys and capillaries being called �pines, or thorns.<br> &nbsp;<br> Albert Vincent&#x2019;s victory rally was held at the town&#x2019;s center&#x2014;the ovule of the rose&#x2014;across from Sainte Rose de Lima Cathedral, which had been repainted a deeper lilac for the inauguration. Albert offered his inaugural address while covering his hands with a black fedora that few had ever seen on his head. On the edge of the crowd, perched on Nozias&#x2019;s shoulder, Claire Limy� Lanm� was wearing her pink muslin birthday dress, her plaited hair covered with tiny bow shaped barrettes. At some point, Claire noticed that she and her father were standing next to a plump woman with a cherubic face framed with a long, straight hairpiece. The woman was wearing black pants and a black blouse and had a white hibiscus pinned behind her ear. She owned Ville Rose&#x2019;s only fabric shop.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thank you for putting your trust in me,&#x201d; Albert Vincent now boomed into the crowd. The speech was at last winding down nearly a half hour after he&#x2019;d begun speaking.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nozias cupped his hands over his mouth as he whispered something in the fabric vendor&#x2019;s ear. It was obvious to Claire that her father had not really come to hear the mayor, but to see the fabric vendor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Later that same evening, the fabric vendor appeared at the shack near the end of Pied Rose Avenue. Claire was expecting to be sent to a neighbor while the fabric vendor stayed alone with her father, but Nozias had insisted that Claire pat her hair down with an old bristle brush and that she straighten out the creases on the ruffled dress that she&#x2019;d kept on all day despite the heat and sun.<br> &nbsp;<br> Standing between Nozias&#x2019;s and Claire&#x2019;s cots in the middle of the shack, the fabric vendor asked Claire to twirl by the light of the kerosene lamp, which was in its usual place on the small table where Claire and Nozias sometimes ate their meals. The walls of the shack were covered with flaking, yellowed copies of <i>La Rosette, </i>the town&#x2019;s newspaper, which had been glued to the wood long ago with manioc paste by Claire&#x2019;s mother. From where she was standing, Claire could see her own stretched-out shadow moving along with the others over the fading words. While twirling for the lady, Claire heard her father say, &#x201c;I am for correcting children, but I am not for whipping.&#x201d; He looked down at Claire and paused. His voice cracked, and he jabbed his thumb into the middle of his palm as he continued. &#x201c;I am for keeping her clean, as you can see. She should of course continue with her schooling, be brought as soon as possible to a doctor when she is sick.&#x201d; Still jabbing at his palm, after having now switched palms, he added, &#x201c;In turn, she would help with some cleaning both at home and at the shop.&#x201d; Only then did Claire realize who this &#x201c;her&#x201d; was that they were talking about, and that her father was trying to give her away.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her legs suddenly felt like lead, and she stopped twirling, and as soon as she stopped, the fabric vendor turned to her father, her fake hair blocking half of her face. Nozias&#x2019;s eyes dropped from the fabric vendor&#x2019;s fancy hairpiece to her pricey open-toed sandals and red toenails.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not tonight,&#x201d; the fabric vendor said, as she headed for the narrow doorway.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nozias seemed stunned, drawing a long breath and letting it out slowly before following the fabric vendor to the door. They thought they were whispering, but Claire could hear them clearly from across the room. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going away,&#x201d; Nozias said. &#x201c;Pou ch�che lavi, to look for a better life.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ohmm.&#x201d; The fabric vendor groaned a warning, like an impossible word, a word she had no idea how to say. &#x201c;Why would you want your child to be my servant, a restav�k?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know she would never be that with you,&#x201d; Nozias said. &#x201c;But this is what would happen anyway, with less kind people than you if I die. I don&#x2019;t have any more family here in town.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Nozias put an end to the fabric vendor&#x2019;s questioning by making a joke about the undertaker&#x2019;s mayoral victory and how many meaningless speeches he would be forced to endure if he remained in Ville Rose. This made the fabric vendor&#x2019;s jingly laugh sound as though it were coming out of her nose. The good news, Claire thought, was that her father did not try to give her away every day. Most of the time, he acted as though he would always keep her. During the week, Claire went to the �cole Ardin, where she received a charity scholarship from the schoolmaster himself, Msye Ardin. And at night, Claire would sit by the kerosene lamp at the small table in the middle of the shack and recite the new words she was learning. Nozias enjoyed the singsong and her hard work and missed it during her holidays from school. The rest of the time, he went out to sea at the crack of dawn and always came back with some cornmeal or eggs, which he&#x2019;d bartered part of his early-morning catch for. He talked about going to work in construction or the fishing trade in the neighboring Dominican Republic, but he would always make it sound as though it were something he and Claire could do together, not something he&#x2019;d have to abandon her to do. But as soon as her birthday came, he would begin talking about it again&#x2014; ch�che lavi: going away to make a better life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lap�ch, fishing, was no longer as profitable as it had once been, she would hear him tell anyone who would listen. It was no longer like in the old days, when he and his friends would put a net in the water for an hour or so, then pull it out full of big, mature fish. Now they had to leave nets in for half a day or longer, and they would pull fish out of the sea that were so small that in the old days they would have been thrown back. But now you had to do with what you got; even if you knew deep in your gut that it was wrong, for example, to keep baby conch shells or lobsters full of eggs, you had no choice but to do it. You could no longer afford to fish in season, to let the sea replenish itself. You had to go out nearly every day, even on Fridays, and even as the seabed was disappearing, and the sea grass that used to nourish the fish was buried under silt and trash.<br> &nbsp;<br> But he was not talking to the fabric vendor about fishing that night. They were talking about Claire. His relatives and his dead wife&#x2019;s relatives, who lived in the villages in the surrounding mountains where he was born, were even poorer than he was, he was saying. If he died, sure they would take Claire, but only because they had no choice, because that&#x2019;s what families do, because no matter what, f�k nou voye je youn sou l�t. We must all look after one another. But he was being careful, he said. He didn&#x2019;t want to leave something as crucial as his daughter&#x2019;s future to chance. <br> &nbsp;<br> After the fabric vendor left, colorful sparks rose up from the hills and filled the night sky over the homes near the lighthouse, in the Anth�re (anther) section of town. Beyond the lighthouse, the hills turned into a mountain, wild and green, and mostly unexplored because the ferns there bore no fruit. The wood was too wet for charcoal and too unsteady for construction. People called this mountain M�n Initil, or Useless Mountain, because there was little there that they wanted. It was also believed to be haunted.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fireworks illuminated the mushroom-shaped tops of the ferns of M�n Initil as well as the gated two-story mansions of Anth�re Hill. They also illuminated the clapboard shacks by the sea and their thatched and tin roofs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once the fabric vendor was gone, Claire and her father rushed out to see the lights exploding in the sky. The alleys between the shacks were jam-packed with their neighbors. With cannonlike explosions, Albert Vincent, the undertaker turned mayor, was celebrating his victory. But as her neighbors clapped in celebration, Claire couldn&#x2019;t help but feel like she was the one who&#x2019;d won. The fabric vendor had said no and she would get to stay with her father another year. <br></p><h2>Graphique de la Rue: The Signs of Paris</h2><p>Paris is a city of pure enchantment, and everyone who loves the City of Light has a Parisian muse, from the Tour Eiffel to <em>cr�me caramel</em>.

She fills the camera with her presence. It is a profound portrait of an artist of the utmost consequence and a piercing study of extreme age.<br><br> Louise Bourgeois was one of the last surviving artists of the high modernist era, and her early work anticipated what would come in the late modern and postmodern eras, including minimalism, installation art, and body art. However, she did not achieve fame until after her seventieth year, discovered and heralded by a new generation. Once discovered, her reputation grew in the 1980s, &#x2019;90s, and 2000s with an array of major international exhibitions and a burst of creativity. Throughout, her art is confessional, psychological, and fraught with fear, anger, and sexuality.<br><br> Van Gelder&#x2019;s collaborative portrait is in many ways a message from Bourgeois to the world, her chosen epitaph, scrawled in her own way by gesture, expression, and posture. Despite the frailty and decrepitude of her near one hundred years, she defies her vulnerability. 81 color photographs</p><p><p><strong>Alex Van Gelder</strong> lives and works in Paris. He has published many books including <em>Life &amp; Afterlife in Benin</em>. He exhibited a portfolio of photographs of Louise Bourgeois's hands in 2011.

Her theatrical spirit seems to defy the incredible frailty of her frame. These photographs are a record of one of our great modern artists, fading in body, still inventing with fervor while she can.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The New Yorker Photo Booth</em></strong></p><h2>City (SFBC 50th Anniversary Collection, 5)</h2><p>First Edition thus of the Science Fiction Book Club 50th. Anniversary collection.</p><p></p><h2>The Essene Gospel of Peace, Book 2: The Unknown Books of the Essenes</h2><p>The Essene method of interpretation of these books is, on the one hand, to place them in harmonious correlation with the laws of the human consciousness and of nature, and, on the other, to consider the facts and circumstances of the age and environment in which they were written. This approach also takes into account the degree of evolution and understanding of the people to whom the particular master was addressing his message. Since all the great masters had to adapt their teaching to the level of their audience, they found it necessary to formulate both an exoteric and esoteric teaching. The exoteric message was one comprehensible to the people at large and was expressed in terms of various rules, forms and rituals corresponding to the basic needs of the people and the age concerned. Parallel with this, the esoteric teachings have survived through the ages partly as written and partly as unwritten living traditions, free from forms, rituals, rules and dogmas, and in all periods have been kept alive and practiced by a small minority. It is in this spirit of the interpretation of the Truth that the Essene Gospel of Peace will be translated in the following pages. Rejecting the dogmatic methods of literal and purely scientific interpretation as well as the exaggeration of the symbolists, we shall try to translate the Essene Gospel of Peace in the light of our consciousness and of nature, and in harmony with the great traditions of the Essenes, to whose brotherhood the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves belonged.</p><p></p><h2>THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES: Rocket Summer; Ylla; The Summer Night; The Earth Men; The Taxpayer; The Third Expedition; And the Moon be Still as Bright; The Settlers; The Green Morning; The Locusts; Night Meeting; The Shore; Interim; The Musicians</h2><p>Ray Bradury&#39;s sometime eerie, sometimes peotic fantasy about the colonization fo Mars.

That is an important feature, as so many of these problems are complex and the solution may not be readily apparent. When mothers are presented with several ways to address a problem, they more likely to persist until the breastfeeding problem is solved.

The Memory Keeper�s Daughter <i>is a powerful combination of a tragic and poignant family story as well as riveting page-turner, due primarily to the fact that it centers on such a shocking act by one individual that affects everyone he cares about. How did the idea for this novel come to you? </i> <p> A few months after my story collection, <i>The Secrets of a Fire King</i> was published, one of the pastors of the Presbyterian church I�d recently joined said she had a story to give me. I was pleased that she�d thought of me, if a bit surprised�I was back in church after a 20-some year absence, and still quite skeptical of it all. Yet even to my critical eye it was clear that good things were happening: the congregation was vibrant and progressive and engaged; the co-pastors, a married couple who had both once been university professors, gave sermons that were beautifully crafted and thought-provoking, both intellectual and heartfelt. I�d already come to admire them very much. Still, it happens fairly often that people want to give me stories, and invariably those stories are not mine to tell. So I thanked my pastor, but didn�t think much more about her offer. </p> <p> The next week she stopped me again. <i>I really have to tell you this story</i>, she said, and she did. It was just a few sentences, about a man who�d discovered, late in life, that his brother had been born with Down�s Syndrome, placed in an institution at birth, and kept a secret from his family, even from his own mother, all his life. He�d died in that institution, unknown. I remember being struck by the story even as she told it, and thinking right away that it really would make a good novel. It was the secret at the center of the family that intrigued me. Still, in the very next heartbeat, I thought: <i>of course, I�ll never write that book</i>.</p> <p> And I didn�t, not for years. The idea stayed with me, however, as the necessary stories do. Eventually, in an unrelated moment, I was invited to do a writing workshop for adults with mental challenges through a Lexington group called Minds Wide Open. I was nervous about doing this, I have to confess. I didn�t have much experience with people who have mental challenges, and I didn�t have any idea of what to expect. As it turned out, we had a wonderful morning, full of expression and surprises and some very fine poetry. At the end of the class, several of the participants hugged me as they left. </p> <p> This encounter made a deep impression on me, and I found myself thinking of this novel idea again, with a greater sense of urgency and interest. Still, it was another year before I started to write it. Then the first chapter came swiftly, almost fully formed, that initial seed having grown tall while I wasn�t really paying attention. In her <i>Paris Review</i> interview, Katherine Anne Porter talks about the event of a story being like a stone thrown in water�she says it�s not the event itself that�s interesting, but rather the ripples the event creates in the lives of characters. I found this to be true. Once I�d written the first chapter, I wanted to find out more about who these people were and what happened to them as a consequence of David�s decision; I couldn�t stop until I knew. <br><br> 2. <i>Human motivation, the simple question of why we do what we do, is often very complex, as it is here with David and his fateful decision. As his creator, were you able to sympathize in any way with his motives? </i></p> <p> Oh, yes, certainly. Even thought none of us may never experience a moment this dramatic, nonetheless we all have similar experiences, times when we react powerfully to an event in ways we may not completely understand until much later, if at all. </p> <p> I knew from the beginning that David wasn�t an evil person. He makes absolutely the wrong decision in that first chapter, but even so he acts out of what he believes are good intentions�the desire to protect Norah from grief, and even the desire to do what the medical community in that time and place had deemed best for a child with Down�s Syndrome. </p> <p> There�s much more to this, of course. David�s own grief at the loss of his sister is something he�s never confronted, never resolved. I don�t think this was unusual in that era. Grief counselors, after all, are relatively new. I remember stories, growing up, of adults in my town who had suffered terrible losses. There was a kind of silence around such people. Everyone knew their history, and the imprint of the loss was visible in the unfolding of their lives, but no one ever mentioned the person who had died. </p> <p> So it was with David. His way of coping with the loss of his sister, and with the greater loss of his family that resulted, was to try to move on; to take control of his life and to push forward; to become a success in the eyes of the world. Yet even so, his grief was never far below the surface, and when Phoebe was born with Down�s Syndrome, an event he could not anticipate or control, his old grief welled up. David�s response in that moment is as much to the past as to the present, but it takes him decades, and a trip back to the place where he grew up, to understand this. <br><br> 3.<i> The novel begins in 1964. Do you think our attitudes toward people with disabilities have changed since then? Are we more enlightened or accepting now?</i></p> <p> Yes, things have changed for the better over the past decades, but I�d say also that it�s an ongoing process, with much more progress yet to be made. </p> <p> Certainly, writing this novel was a process of enlightenment for me. When I began this book, I didn�t know how to imagine Phoebe. I was compelled by the secret and its impact on the family, but I wasn�t very knowledgeable about Down�s Syndrome. To create a convincing character, one who was herself and not a stereotype, without being either sentimental or patronizing, seemed a daunting task.</p> <p> I started reading and researching. Also, tentatively, I started having conversations. The first couple I spoke with has a daughter whom they�d raised during the time period of this book. They were a terrific help, candid and straightforward and wise. When I showed them the opening chapter, their immediate response was that I�d gotten the doctor exactly right: the attitudes David has about Down�s Syndrome may seem outrageous to us now, but there was a time, not all that long ago, when these ideas were widely held. </p> <p> The reason attitudes have changed, quite simply, is because the parents of children with Down�s Syndrome refused, as Caroline does in this novel, to accept imposed limitations for their children. The fight that Caroline fights during this book is emblematic of struggles that took place all over the country during this era to change prevailing attitudes and to open doors that had been slammed shut. </p> <p> The changes did not and do not happen easily, or without personal costs for those who struggled�and struggle still�to make their children visible to the world. Time and again as I researched this book I heard stories of both heartbreak and great courage. Time and again, also, I was impressed with the expansive generosity of people with Down�s Syndrome and their families, who met with me, shared their life journeys and perceptions, their joys and struggles, and were eager to help me learn. Many of them have read the book and loved it, which for me is a profound measure of its success. <br><br> 4. <i>Your use of photography as a metaphor throughout the book is artfully done. Do you have a personal interest in photography, or did you educate yourself about it as part of the writing process?</i></p> <p> I�m not a photographer, but for several years in college I was very good friends with people who were, some of whom, in fact, had darkrooms set up in their houses. Photography was woven into many of our conversations, and I sometimes went with my friends when they were seeking particular shots. I wasn�t at all interested in the mechanics�apertures and f-stops left me cold� but I was always fascinated by the photographs appearing in the developer, what was invisible coaxed into image by the chemical bath. It�s a slow emergence, a kind of birth, really; a moment of mystery. I was intrigued by the use of light, as well, the way too much light will erase an image on both film and paper. </p> <p> I also remember being annoyed, more than once, when my friends� need to get a photo right interfered with the moment the photo was meant to capture: at a family reunion, for instance, or a birthday party. How did the presence of the photographer change the nature of the moment? What was gained and what was lost by having the eye of the camera present? </p> <p> During the very early stages of writing this novel, I read a New Yorker essay about the photographer Walker Evans that discussed many of these questions quite eloquently, reminding me of my photographer friends. Norah gave David a camera, and from there I started doing quite a lot of research. Amid many other explorations, I spent time at Eastman Kodak Museum in Rochester and read Susan Sontag�s fascinating and inspiring <i>On Photography</i>. <br><br> 5. <i>The city of Pittsburgh figures quite prominently in the story and is described in very affectionate terms. ("The city of Pittsburgh gleaming suddenly before her . . . so startling in its vastness and its beauty that she had gasped and slowed, afraid of losing control of the car" p. 91.) This is not a city that usually captures the imagination nor has it been a common setting for novels. Would you talk a bit about why you chose Pittsburgh and your personal connection, if any, to it?</i></p> <p> I moved to Pittsburgh sight unseen�my husband and I were teaching in Cambodia when he was accepted into a Ph.D. program at The University of Pittsburgh. This was before e-mail; there were no telephones in Phnom Penh, and even electricity was often sporadic. With no clear image of Pittsburgh, we agreed to move there, visions of steel smoke and gritty industrialism hanging like a shadow when he sent in his acceptance.</p> <p></p> <p>Caroline�s experience crossing the Fort Pitt bridge is my own. It�s a spectacular moment: one emerges from the endless Fort Pitt tunnel onto a bridge spanning the Monogahela River, just before it merges with the Allegheny River and forms the Ohio River. Water gleams everywhere, and the buildings of the city narrow to the point between the rivers, and in the middle distance the greening hills rise up, studded with houses. The director of the MFA program at the University of Pittsburgh once confided to me how much he liked to drive visitors in from the airport, because they were invariably astonished by this view.</p> <p></p> <p>I spent four years in Pittsburgh and would have happily stayed there had circumstances allowed. It�s a fascinating city, rich with history and parks. It�s wonderful city for walking, too, with beautiful old neighborhoods and places where you find yourself suddenly standing on a bluff again, gazing out over the ever-changing rivers. <br><br> 6. The Memory Keeper�s Daughter, <i>while ultimately redemptive and hopeful, reveals much of the dark side of the human experience. Actors often talk about how working on a very painful role can affect their psyche; others speak of being able simply to let it go and not have the work affect their daily lives. As a writer, how does working on such a heart-wrenching story affect your own state of mind? When you stop writing, are you able to let it go?</i></p> <p> Well, they all struggle, don�t they? They walk through a lot darkness. Yet I never found writing this book painful. In part, I think, I identified with all the characters in this book: the one who keeps a secret and the one from whom secrets have been kept; the parent who longs for a child and the child who longs for harmony and wholeness; the wanderer and the one who stays in place. I recognized their journeys of self-discovery, in any case. I was interested in them, and I wanted to know what happened to them, and who they were. The only way to discover all that was to write the book. Also, because the novel is told through four different points of view, moving from one character�s mind to another, I was able step back from one point of view and work on another whenever I was stuck. This was very liberating, and allowed me to attain a certain level of detachment from one character while working on another. <br><br> 7. <i>As an award-winning short story writer, you are best known for your critically acclaimed collection The Secrets of a Fire King. Would you talk a bit about how you came to write a novel, and the difference between working on a novel and a short story?</i></p> <p> When my story collection was published, several reviewers remarked that each one contained the scope of a novel. That interested me, because the stories always felt like stories; I couldn�t imagine them being a word longer then they were. Likewise, <i>The Memory Keeper�s Daughter</i> was a novel from the moment I started writing. Yet despite the difference in complexity and length, writing a novel was very much like writing stories. There�s a bigger canvas in a novel, and thus more room to explore, but it�s still a process of discovery, a leap into the unknown, and an intuitive seeking of the next moment, and the next. For me, writing is never linear, though I do believe quite ardently in revision. I think of revision as a kind of archeology, a deep exploration of the text to discover what�s still hidden and bring it to the surface. <br><br> 8. <i>Who are some of your favorite authors, and what are you currently reading?</i></p> <p> I read a great deal. Alice Munro and William Trevor are authors whose work I return to again and again. I have just finished Marilynne Robinson�s <i>Gilead</i> and I will read it again soon simply to savor the beauty of the language. New books by both Ursula Hegi and Sue Monk Kidd are on my desk, along with the poems of Pablo Neruda. During the writing of <i>The Memory Keeper�s Daughter</i> I returned to classic novels with secrets at their center, especially Dostoevsky�s extraordinary <i>Crime and Punishment</i> and Hawthorne�s <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>. I�m also midway through Thomas Mann�s quartet of novels based on the story of Joseph and his brothers; these archetypal stories are informing the next novel I plan to write, as well. <br><br> 9. <i>What are you working on now?</i></p> <p> I have begun a new novel, called <i>The Dream Master</i>. It�s set in the Finger Lakes area of upstate New York where I grew up, which is stunningly beautiful, and which remains in some real sense the landscape of my imagination. Like <i>The Memory Keeper�s Daughter</i>, this new novel turns on the idea of a secret�that seems to be my preoccupation as a writer--though in this case the event occurred in the past and is a secret from the reader as well as from the characters, so structurally, and in its thematic concerns, the next book is an entirely new discovery. <br><br> <b>questions for discussion</b> <br><br> 1.

Indians retained control over most of the lands in Spain&#x2019;s American empire. Mounted on horseback, savvy about European ways, and often possessing firearms, independent Indians continued to find new ways to resist subjugation by Spanish soldiers and conversion by Spanish missionaries.<p></p>In this panoramic study, David J. Weber explains how late eighteenthcentury Spanish administrators tried to fashion a more enlightened policy toward the people they called <i>b�rbaros, </i>or savages.&#x201d; Even Spain&#x2019;s most powerful monarchs failed, however, to enforce a consistent, well-reasoned policy toward Indians. At one extreme, powerful independent Indians forced Spaniards to seek peace, acknowledge autonomous tribal governments, and recognize the existence of tribal lands, fulfilling the Crown&#x2019;s oft-stated wish to use gentle&#x201d; means in dealing with Indians. At the other extreme the Crown abandoned its principles, authorizing bloody wars on Indians when Spanish officers believed they could defeat them. Power, says Weber, more than the power of ideas, determined how Spaniards treated savages&#x201d; in the Age of Enlightenment.<p></p></p><p>"This is a pathbreaking, tightly organized, surefooted book.

Melissa has no recollection of his murder and is terrified that he will avenge himself by taking her life. When she meets the "real" Paul at a dance, she begins to understand that his death will occur in the future, and she and the ghost Paul unsuccessfully try to change the future. Readers will identify with Melissa, who is caring and compassionate, while Paul is a typical tough guy. Still, his is a well-drawn characterization. In other titles in this series, Fear Street is described as a menacing place; the appropriate details help create and sustain that mood. That description is glossed over in this book, diminishing the suspense.

Although the stories are thematically unrelated, an undercurrent of mortality weights many of the tales with a powerful sense of humanity's frailties. Two of the best pieces are "A Letter from the Clearys" and "The Sidon in the Mirror," both of which show people reacting to death in characteristically odd (and disappointingly human) ways. Fans of Willis's time-travel books, <i>The Doomsday Book</i> and <i>To Say Nothing of the Dog</i>, will be delighted to find that the title story tells of another hapless Oxford history student sent back to World War II Britain to learn a hard lesson. Just when the book threatens to leave you morose and depressed, Willis reveals her wonderfully absurdist side in "Mail Order Clone" and "Blued Moon." Willis is a master of the novel, but her short stories are superb reading as well.

Today it seems inevitable that the thirteen colonies would declare their independence from Britain. And yet in 1776 it was not so. Here is the extraordinary story of drama and daring, sacrifice and selflessness, danger and potential death. The signers concluded their work with a plea for Providential protection and a selfless vow to sacrifice "our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor." Many of them did just that to create a country in which "all men are created equal, . . . endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these, are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."</p><p>Award-winning historian Rod Gragg brings to life the drama of 1776 like no other book.

In Village Christmas, a family new to Fairacre is viewed with suspicion by their elderly neighbors, the Waters sisters, until an unexpected turn of events works magic over both houses on Christmas Day. Meanwhile, Mrs. Berry, in the nearby village of Caxley, faces an equally eventful Christmas Eve in The Christmas Mouse when she is awakened by two unexpected intruders: a mouse and a bedraggled runaway boy, both taking refuge from a winter storm. Both stories are resolved in Miss Read&#39;s comforting style, as warm as the glowing coals of the cottage fire and the spirit of Christmas itself. Miss Read&#39;s Christmas Tales are a treat for those who already know Miss Read and a charming introduction to her books for those who do not.

Rachel&#39;s first book Five Quarters won the Andre Simon Food Book award in 2015, as well as the Guild of Food Writers&#39; First Book award. Rachel has lived in Testaccio, a distinctive working-class quarter of Rome, for over twelve years. She shares a small flat near the food market with her partner Vincenzo and son Luca and spends part of the year in Vincenzo&#39;s family house in Gela, south-east Sicily. racheleats.wordpress.com Follow Rachel on Twitter @racheleats Follow Rachel on Instagram @rachelaliceroddyFive Quarters stands out as particularly considered and evocative...Impeccably researched and transportive, it's a proper read, rather than a quick flick. -- AA Gill * Sunday Times, picked as best cookbook 2015 * Unpretentious, unusual and delicious. * Country Life * The writing beautifully describes a quiet domestic life centred around her kitchen, while the photography by Roddy herself is reminiscent of Dutch interiors. * Ham &amp; High * Rachel Roddy's Five Quarters is by an English food blogger settled in Rome, who felt a natural affinity with the simplicity and resourcefulness of Roman cooking; this is a homage to the quarter in which she lives and the food of her neighbours. * Evening Standard * This wonderful book, which came about as a result of an award-winning blog, charts a year of cooking in the tiny kitchen in her flat, shopping at local markets and writing about her culinary finds... an unputdownable book packed with the unpretentious home cooking, heady with the smells of Southern Italian markets. * Crumb Magazine * Just looking at the juicy apricots on the cover of this recipe and memory-filled love letter to Rome is enough to transport you to Italia - land of delicious, superior, mouth-watering cuisine... Five Quarters illuminates the colourful experience of a year in her Italian kitchen where she cooked, ate and wrote, with her notes contributing to the book's 120 both Italian and British-influenced recipes. * Scottish Woman Magazine * This is the most wonderful cookbook, especially - though not exclusively - if you like really reading cookbooks, possibly in bed. Rachel Roddy is a marvellous writer, and her ruminations about living in Rome - about markets, pasta-cooking water, being unfaithful to her usual butcher, Jane Grigson, the old Jewish ghetto, letting the meatballs rest, her daily life and so on, are total heaven (also, excellent restaurant recommendations). What I especially like is that she sounds like a real, complicated-in-a-good-way, intelligent and forthright person, not some ninny going 'Ooh, I love Italy, me' while poncing about on a Vespa. She is proper. You feel like a friend is leading you by the hand, going 'Look at this, make this, and if you make it like this it will taste even better'. The recipes are great. The vast majority are simple, family-friendly things you or I could make for supper with minimum fuss, and everyone would pat their stomachs delightedly and go 'Man, that was unbelievably good'. Everything I've cooked has been delicious, unfussy, robust and somehow honest. More than once I've been surprised by the simplicity of the recipe and the complex deliciousness of the results. Very precise instructions, too. Plus, a beautiful-looking book, beautifully produced, which doesn't hurt. * India Knight * Roddy is a gifted storyteller, and a masterful hand with simple ingredients. She brings to life in mouthwatering detail her culinary love and daily discoveries from a life lived well, of Roman markets and full family tables. * Guardian Cook * Like the best food writing Five Quarters is also a form of travel writing, as it provides a taste of history, memoir and literate display. It is a form of utopian thinking too, you could argue. This is how we might live, it implicitly says. Or at least look at the pictures of how we might live. Why do we love cookery books? Because the best ones are about so much more. Rachel Roddy - like Yotam [Ottolenghi] and Nigel [Slater] - is writing about a sense of place, about culinary culture and culture in general. In short, she is writing about life. The nice pictures are just a bonus. * Herald * I felt that prickle of excitement that you get when you get your hands on a book that you know will be a friend in the kitchen for months and years to come. * Matching Food and Wine *</p><h2>The Big Book of Buds: Marijuana Varieties from the World&#39;s Great Seed Breeders (Big Book of Buds, 1)</h2><p>This full-color guide showcases the diversity of cannabis varieties.

Basking in the glow of her most adoring fans-who all happened to be her most duplicitous enemies-Mary would make her final performance. When Superintendent Roderick Alleyn arrives, he smells a rat amongst the contemptuous collection of theatre types detained at the party, for this case has the unmistakable scent of murder...<br></p><p>From her first book in 1934 to her final volume just before her death in 1982, <b>Ngaio Marsh</b>'s work has remained legendary, and is often compared to that of Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers.

So sit back, draw the curtains, lock the doors, and put yourself in the hands of Grande Dame of detective novels...<br>An aging actress of the London stage, Mary Bellamy is getting ready for her fiftieth birthday. To the outside world Mary is charm itself. But inside her circle of family and friends, Mary's evermore frequent "tempers" are taking their toll. It seems one secret too many may have been let loose when Mary is found dead after using her birthday perfume, which turns out to be deadly insecticide. The suspects mount as Inspector Roderick Alleyn sorts through this pack of posers and prima donnas. James Saxon is in perfect voice, playing this dramatic bunch to the hilt. He gets special mileage from the in-house war being fought between the faithful lady's maid and the old nurse with a fondness for port. He moves between high and lowbrow accents with assurance and a quick-moving sense of fun. In some cases the characters become caricatures of themselves, and this only adds to the sense of theater.

Based on years of research, Ann Baer brings to life the reality of a world that has been lost. Rising before dawn in a tiny village to a day of grueling hard work, Marion and her husband face the daily struggle for survival. Starvation is never far away and travel to the next village is virtually unheard of. Existing without soap, paper or glass and with only the most basic of tools, sickness, fire and natural disaster ever threaten to engulf the small, tightly knit community. At the mercy of the weather and the Lord of the Manor, each equally unpredictable and inescapable, Marion&#x2019;s life is burdensome but also displays an admirable dignity and fortitude in the face of adversity. The little village is at one with the natural world around it and each member has a role to play and a place in the hierarchy. Simple people, living unrecorded lives in remote villages not on the way to anywhere are brought back into focus in<i> Medieval Woman</i>.

But Grace doesn&#39;t know how her boss secretly wrestles with those demons: by tagging buildings as the Bird, a notorious but unidentified graffiti artist an alter ego that could destroy his career and land him in prison. Like Roman, Grace is wrestling with ghosts and secrets of her own. After a disastrous marriage threw her life completely off course, she vowed never to let love steal her dreams again. But as she gets to know the enigmatic man behind the reputation, it&#39;s as if the jagged pieces of both of their pasts slowly begin to fit together . . . until something so unexpected happens that it changes the course of their relationship and both their lives forever.

Recently, she has found a home for herself and her 5-month-old son, Samuel, but living with the Garcias, who had hoped to adopt Samuel, is difficult, especially since Selah consistently pushes Grace away, casting herself as the boy&#x2019;s constant maternal presence. So when Grace accepts a job as the temperamental Roman&#x2019;s personal assistant, complete with a cottage to herself &#x2015;a cottage where she can start to separate from Selah and her family, where she can build a life for herself and Samuel &#x2015;it&#x2019;s a dream come true. Roman&#x2019;s rough language and atheism, however, trouble Grace, just as Grace&#x2019;s spirituality and privacy trouble Roman. After all, he&#x2019;s used to easy women and commitment-free interludes. Christian novelist Rivers (Earth Psalms, 2016, etc.) deftly threads Roman&#x2019;s and Grace&#x2019;s lives together as they tiptoe around their emotional scars, eventually shifting into a dance of tentative steps toward a love neither can resist. Fans of Christian romance will delight in this tale of salvation through love. (Kirkus Reviews)<br><br>Bestseller Rivers (<i>Redeeming Love</i>) brings unexpected faith to a fictionalized Banksy character in this ambitious novel. Roman Velasco is an artist who has his own studio, rising prestige, and large commissions&#x2015;yet he keeps secret his life as the Bird, a renowned and elusive graffiti artist. Roman has searched for meaning in women, drink, and art but finds himself empty and angry. Enter Grace Moore, an emotionally wounded single mother who finds her meaning in God. She signs on as Roman&#x2019;s personal assistant, eager for the job but not so sure about the temperamental artist. Rivers pits the brokenness of these two&#x2015;Roman&#x2019;s abandonment and trust issues and Grace&#x2019;s guilt and pain&#x2015;against each other and the power of Jesus. Although Rivers too often uses phrases such as &#x201c;he muttered a four-letter word&#x201d; in place of cruder words, and frequently reverts to what feels like Christian jargon (&#x201c;Two people saved by grace. That makes you my brother in Christ.&#x201d;), the tale will have her long-standing fans hooked. And the fully formed Roman will likely garner her new ones. (Publishers Weekly)<br><br>4.5 stars, <b>Romantic Times Top Pick</b><br><br>The long wait between Francine Rivers&#x2019; novels is well worth it when the final page of this book is turned. Richly detailed characters with traumatic pasts are woven together with Biblical truths and redemptive themes. On the surface, this seems like a very basic romance, but when the layers are peeled back, each of the characters&#x2019; choices in the past and present are thoughtfully explored. As Roman and Grace learn about each other, the reader, too, learns about them as glimpses into their lives are revealed carefully as they relate to current experiences. This is an amazing, beautifully written tale to be savored and pondered and shared with others. (Romantic Times)<br><br>Best-selling Rivers (<i>Bridge to Haven</i>, 2014) presents a lengthy, emotionally uninhibited tale of childhood trauma and its affects in adulthood. She handles the difficult topics of addiction, emotional abuse, gang activity, and murder-suicide, all connected to children, with unapologetic directness. Her writing is grounded in conservative Christian values and touches on deeper points of theology and the afterlife. Readers will marvel at Rivers&#x2019; storytelling arc encompassing the reconciliation of gritty past misdeeds with the work in progress of a life of forgiveness. (Booklist)<br><br>Famous artist Roman Velasco battles his demons in the night as The Bird, a graffiti artist. This alter ego draws from Roman&#x2019;s past before fame and fortune made him wealthy but empty inside. Grace Moore is a suddenly single mother who needs to work. After her husband&#x2019;s betrayal, she finds comfort in her faith. When an opportunity comes her way to be the personal assistant to the reclusive Roman, Grace is cautious but hopeful that the opportunity will give her some much-needed security. Little does either of them know how much they need each other. <b>VERDICT</b> Rivers (<i>Earth Psalms</i>) is known for creating memorable characters whose brokenness serves as a pathway to redemption and finding faith in Jesus. This character-driven romance will enthrall her many fans.

Like Wolfe's other novels, The Web and the Rock is an autobiographical account of a successful young writer from North Carolina living in New York City in the early 20th century. The main character, George Webber, bears many similarities to Eugene Gant, the soul-searching protagonist of Wolfe's earlier novels Look Homeward, Angel (1929) and Of Time and The River (1935). Esther Jack, who first appeared in Of Time and the River, is an urban sophisticate who becomes Webber's lover and muse. The Web and the Rock has been criticized for its inconsistent style but praised for its poetry and passion. Its sequel is You Can't Go Home Again (1940). -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i>Published posthumously in 1939, this novel introduces George Webber, whose saga is followed up in Wolfe's signature work, You Can't Go Home Again. The story begins with Webber's North Carolina upbringing and moves on to his relocation to New York City, where he meets wealthy socialite Esther Jack, who introduces him to a whole new world.

"Indigo Engineers" juxtaposes mechanized objects of destruction, built for a sort of performance-art piece, with the just-following-orders mentality of Nazis. A serial killer with a dual personality murders winos with Drano in "The Blue Yonder," which documents the lives of alcoholics living in shelters or parks. Whether recounting a tale of a band of Indian thugs a la Munchausen, laconically noting episodes in personal relationships or dealing with the relentless realism of skinheads and hookers, Vollman writes with deadpan humor, self-assurance and incredible ability. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Spiral (Tunnels Book 5)</h2><p>Spinning out of control!<br><br>Just when you thought it couldn't get any deeper, darker, or weirder...<br><br>Creeping into the open through cracks in the earth, the Styx have surfaced, and are now infesting England like some parasitic scourge -- carriers of a bizarre black secret that will place every last Topsoiler in mortal peril. <br><br>Unless Will Burrows puts a stop to the propagation.<br><br>Armed to the teeth, with little more than a motley crew of former commandos as reinforcements, can Will, Chester, and Elliott find a way to squash the threat?

Her husband Hugo had been absent half an hour, and it wasn&#x2019;t like him to stay away longer than he said. Especially not this night.<br>For tonight, after seventeen years of marriage, Hugo&#x2019;s father, Good Magician Humfrey, had finally removed the Spell of Hiding that kept the storks from being aware of Wira no matter how ardently she summoned them. She was fifty-five years old chronologically, thirty-three physically, and her thyme was starting to wilt. If they waited much longer, the storks would never deliver to her, regardless of any spell. This time the signal would go out. She knew that Hugo was eager to send that signal, and so was she.<br>Where was he? He had gone to the cellar to fetch a celebratory bottle of Rhed Whine. That should have taken no more than ten minutes, and he would hardly have dawdled. Something was wrong.<br>Wira got off the bed, donned a nightrobe and slippers, and made her way out of their chamber. She pattered down the familiar stairs to the ground floor, and thence to the cellar. She knew every crevice of the castle, of course, and made no misstep.<br>But as she reached the cellar floor, she experienced a faint tinge of uneasiness. Her magic talent was Sensitivity, and though it normally applied to people, plants, and animals, it could sometimes attune to situations. This situation was uncomfortable.<br>&#x201c;Hugo?&#x201d; she called tentatively.<br>There was no answer.<br>The tinge became less faint. In fact it intensified into a wary semblance of dread.<br>&#x201c;Hugo, where are you?&#x201d; she called less tentatively.<br>There was a definitely untentative silence.<br>Something was wrong. Not only was Hugo absent, there was something else in the cellar. She smelled its misty essence.<br>She snapped her fingers. Little magic echoes bounced off the cellar walls and floor, verifying its dimensions. Except for a muffled place on the floor, the vague shape of a man lying down.<br>Had Hugo fainted? But this wasn&#x2019;t Hugo. The shape was vaguely wrong, and of course the smell.<br>She squatted and reached forward to touch it. Her fingers encountered a clammy kind of flesh. It was definitely not quite alive.<br>Wira screamed.<br>The Gorgon, Humfrey&#x2019;s Designated Wife of the Month, and coincidentally also Hugo&#x2019;s mother, was the first to respond. &#x201c;Wira, dear,&#x201d; she called from the head of the cellar stairs. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter? Are you hurt?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, Mother Gorgon, there&#x2019;s a dead man here, and I think he&#x2019;s not quite human. And Hugo is gone.&#x201d;<br>There was half a pause. &#x201c;This bears investigation. Let me fetch a lamp.&#x201d;<br>Wira waited by the body while the Gorgon got the lamp. Wira did not need light, of course, as she was blind. She had always been that way, and really did not mind it as long as she was in familiar territory. But others had some kind of problem with darkness.<br>She heard the returning footsteps, smelled the curling vapors of the lamp, and felt its slight warmth. There was also the faint sibilance of a small nest of snakes. The Gorgon was back and ready to take charge.<br>Wira had always gotten along well with the Gorgon. That was partly because the Gorgon&#x2019;s face tended to turn others to stone, but Wira could not see it, so was not at risk. That enabled them to be friends without precautions. The Gorgon was actually a very nice person, but strangers tended to be prejudiced by her magic face, and were nervous about her snake hair. The snakes were normally friendly, and could be good company on a dull day.<br>&#x201c;It is definitely a body,&#x201d; the Gorgon said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not breathing and it&#x2019;s cold, so it must be at least halfway dead. But who killed it, and what is it doing here?&#x201d;<br>Wira had a horrible thought. &#x201c;Oh Mother Gorgon, you don&#x2019;t suppose Hugo could have&#x2014;have&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course not, dear. Hugo doesn&#x2019;t have a murderous bone in his body. Not even a stiff one, as far as anyone knows. When are you two going to signal the stork?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tonight,&#x201d; Wira said, blushing. Sometimes the Gorgon&#x2019;s language was a trifle serpentine. But she had reason: her sister the Siren was long since a grandmother. She seemed to have forgotten about the stork-hiding spell.<br>Now the Gorgon had a nasty thought. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t suppose he could have gotten cold feet, or whatever?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Never,&#x201d; Wira said positively. &#x201c;He wanted to&#x2014;to do it. To be a father.&#x201d;<br>The Gorgon sighed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s so young.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mother, he&#x2019;s forty-three.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br>Wira didn&#x2019;t argue the case. Technically she was a dozen years older than Hugo, but she had been youthened to sweet sixteen to marry him, so seemed a decade younger. Mothers always thought their sons were too young. &#x201c;He wouldn&#x2019;t have left without word to me. Especially not tonight. Something must have happened to him.&#x201d;<br>The Gorgon was focusing on the body. &#x201c;I have another foul thought. Maybe somebody killed this poor man, dumped the body here, and abducted Hugo to frame him for the murder. That would explain everything.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Except where Hugo is, and who the victim is, and who the real murderer is,&#x201d; Wira agreed.<br>&#x201c;Yes, there may be a detail or three to fill out. We&#x2019;d better get Humfrey in on it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s nighttime,&#x201d; Wira protested. &#x201c;He gets grumpy when disturbed at night.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He gets grumpy any time,&#x201d; the Gorgon said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t see much of it because you have an ameliorative effect on him. I think if he&#x2019;d been half a century younger he would have married you himself.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mother Gorgon!&#x201d; Wira exclaimed, horrified.<br>&#x201c;Oh come on now, girl. You know he&#x2019;s taken with you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m his daughter-in-law.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That, too. Anyway, he already has about five wives too many; he certainly doesn&#x2019;t need any more. Now I&#x2019;m going to get him up, grumpy or not, and bring him down here to fathom the situation. It will give him another pretext to bury himself in the Book of Answers.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I hope the Answer is there!&#x201d; Wira breathed. &#x201c;I miss Hugo so much!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s been gone only half an hour, dear.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, and it&#x2019;s awful.&#x201d;<br>The Gorgon gazed at her. Wira could tell when someone was looking at her; there was a certain subtle mood. &#x201c;You really do love him, don&#x2019;t you, dear.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And that is why I am taken with you, Wira. Without you he&#x2019;s pretty much a rotten-fruited gnome.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He is not!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course not, dear,&#x201d; the Gorgon agreed, smiling knowingly. Wira could also tell when a person was smiling; it curled up the corners of the voice. Then the Gorgon went off to roust out the Good Magician.<br>Wira remained in the cellar, uncertain what else to do. She knew the Gorgon meant well, but the woman sometimes unnerved her. Meanwhile, there was this awful situation to deal with. Could someone really have tried to frame Hugo for the murder? To make it seem that he had committed a terrible crime, and fled the scene? But how could such a thing have been done here, in the Good Magician&#x2019;s Castle? The castle was enchanted to exclude all but the most powerful magic.<br>Yet something of the sort had happened. That was frightening in itself.<br>She checked the shelves along the cellar wall, just in case there was some indication that would help resolve the mystery. She knew the stored potions by the shapes of their bottles and faint odors. The first shelf held bottles of pills from pharm-assist plants that a pill pusher had harvested for the Good Magician long ago. The pills lent certain temporary talents to those who swallowed them. There were gra-pills that enabled folk to wrestle well, purr-pills that caused folk to turn reddish blue while feeling very satisfied, and ap-pills that kept doctors away. Also princi-pills for those lacking in ethics, sim-pills for those with too much intellect, and pill-fur coats for those who didn&#x2019;t mind stealing clothing. All was in order, undisturbed.<br>The next shelf contained assorted gloves or mitts reserved for particular Challenges: an amity, which made a person very friendly; an enmity, which had the opposite effect; a hermit, which was a solitary lady&#x2019;s glove; an imitate that enabled a person to copy things; a comity that made the wearer courteous; an emit that caused a stink; an omit that somehow had been left off the list; a submit that could be used underwater; a permit that allowed almost anything; and an admit that added a glove and also let a person into the castle. At the end of the shelf was a vomit that she knew better than to touch. None had been disturbed. The problem seemed to be confined to the (ugh) body.<br>&#x201c;Ludicrous, woman,&#x201d; Humfrey&#x2019;s voice came grumpily from above. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t it wait until morning?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you want poor Wira to stay in the cellar all night?&#x201d; the Gorgon&#x2019;s voice retorted.<br>Wira had to smile, wanly. The Gorgon was using her to make Humfrey mind. It was true that the Good Magician liked her, though Wira was sure it was not in the way the Gorgon had implied. Wira was sensitive to his moods, and so could manage him to an ex...</p><h2>The Enigma of Reason</h2><p><p>Reason, we are told, is what makes us human, the source of our knowledge and wisdom. If reason is so useful, why didn&#x2019;t it also evolve in other animals? If reason is that reliable, why do we produce so much thoroughly reasoned nonsense? In their groundbreaking account of the evolution and workings of reason, Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber set out to solve this double enigma. Reason, they argue with a compelling mix of real-life and experimental evidence, is not geared to solitary use, to arriving at better beliefs and decisions on our own. What reason does, rather, is help us justify our beliefs and actions to others, convince them through argumentation, and evaluate the justifications and arguments that others address to us.</p><p>In other words, reason helps humans better exploit their uniquely rich social environment. This interactionist interpretation explains why reason may have evolved and how it fits with other cognitive mechanisms. It makes sense of strengths and weaknesses that have long puzzled philosophers and psychologists&#x2015;why reason is biased in favor of what we already believe, why it may lead to terrible ideas and yet is indispensable to spreading good ones.</p><p>Ambitious, provocative, and entertaining, <i>The Enigma of Reason </i>will spark debate among psychologists and philosophers, and make many reasonable people rethink their own thinking.</p></p><p><p>Hugo Mercier is a researcher at the French National Center for Scientific Research, working in the Cognitive Science Institute Marc Jeannerod in Lyon.</p><p>Dan Sperber is a researcher in the Departments of Cognitive Science and of Philosophy at the Central European University, Budapest, and in the Institut Jean Nicod at the �cole Normale Sup�rieure, Paris.</p>&#x201c;Reasonable-seeming people are often totally irrational. Rarely has this insight seemed more relevant than it does right now. Still, an essential puzzle remains: How did we come to be this way? In <i>The Enigma of Reason</i>, the cognitive scientists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber take a stab at answering this question... [Their] argument runs, more or less, as follows: Humans&#x2019; biggest advantage over other species is our ability to cooperate. Cooperation is difficult to establish and almost as difficult to sustain. For any individual, freeloading is always the best course of action. Reason developed not to enable us to solve abstract, logical problems...[but] to resolve the problems posed by living in collaborative groups.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Elizabeth Kolbert</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Yorker</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Enigma of Reason</i> is a comprehensive and well-motivated overview of the contemporary scientific and philosophical literature on reasoning. This is especially timely as we struggle to make sense of how it is that individuals and communities persist in holding beliefs that have been thoroughly discredited.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Darren Frey</b><b>, </b><b><i>Science</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Brilliant...Turns reason&#x2019;s weaknesses into strengths, arguing that its supposed flaws are actually design features that work remarkably well...Timely and necessary.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Julian Baggini</b><b>, </b><b><i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;As evolutionary psychologists, Mercier and Sperber ask what might have been adaptive for our ancestors and thus built into our brains. Some have argued for modules specialized for reasoning about particular topics. But Mercier and Sperber argue for a single module that can frame an argument and its conclusion: the former aids cooperation and the latter communication. So, the ultimate goal of reasoning is persuasion. It&#x2019;s an extraordinarily ambitious theory presented with brilliant insights, profound scholarship, and entertaining anecdotes.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Philip Johnson-Laird, Princeton University</b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a terrific book.

While Gellhorn's wartime dispatches rank among the best of the century, her personal letters are their equal: as vivid and fascinating as anything she ever published. <br><br>Gellhorn's correspondence from 1930 to 1996--chronicling friendships with figures as diverse as Eleanor Roosevelt, Leonard Bernstein, and H. G. Wells, as well as her tempestuous marriage to Ernest Hemingway--paint a vivid picture of the twentieth century as she lived it. <br><br>Caroline Moorehead, who was granted exclusive access to the letters, has expertly edited this fascinating volume, providing prefatory and interstitial material that contextualizes Gellhorn's correspondence within the arc of her entire life. The letters introduce us to the woman behind the correspondent--a writer of wit, charm, and vulnerability. The result is an exhilarating, intimate portrait of one of the most accomplished women of modern times. <br><br></p><p>A distinguished biographer, Caroline Moorehead has also served as a columnist on human rights for two British newspapers. She is the author of <i>Gellhorn</i> (0-8050-7696-4) and lives in London.<br><br>Preface<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>Martha Gellhorn belonged to the age - perhaps the last age - when writing letters was a natural part of life. As a reporter and a novelist, with a precise eye for detail, she was also herself a natural letter writer, and all her life she used letters as a prism through which to filter what she saw and heard, and as a way of keeping close to her friends. She wrote more or less as she spoke, with humor and self-deprecation, full of fury about corrupt and evil governments. She wanted to make her friends laugh and she also wanted to talk to them, for conversation was what she really enjoyed. Letters were talk. "I felt like talking today," she wrote to Victoria Glendinning toward the end of her life, explaining the reason for her particularly long letter, "and felt like talking about books."<br>&nbsp;<br>Because there was seldom a significant stretch of time when Martha was not moving around, letters were what held her life together. She started traveling at the age of twenty and never stopped. "I have only to go to a different country, sky, language, scenery to feel it is worth living," she told a friend when she was in her late seventies. Martha wrote letters every day, often describing the same particularly significant episodes to several people. When troubling things happened, she wrote them out, in long, anguished passages, as if only by writing could she lessen her own sense of grief. Then, often, she would write the whole thing again later, as a short story or novella or a scene in a novel. "The only way I can make it seem real to me is to write," she told Bernard Berenson.<br>&nbsp;<br>In an afterword to the 1986 Virago edition of <i>A Stricken Field</i>, a novel about Czechoslovakia in 1939 and written at the time, Martha lamented the fact that she had never kept a "writer's compost heap" of diaries, journals, notes, or photographs. The archive of her past was "a poor thing, limited and fragmentary"; furthermore, her memory was terrible and she forgot everything. What she did not take into account then were her letters. And even if she did not keep them, others did. Read together, with her erratic spelling and her particular use of words, they provide an immediate and intimate portrait of a remarkable life.<br>&nbsp;<br>Martha's letters are very seldom about social life, though she could be sharp and witty when in large gatherings. She loathed parties, formal dinners, and public life and was easily bored. She really did not mind what people thought about her and was not interested in trying to please. What she liked was friendship and love, in all their guises. To friends and lovers, to her mother, brother, adopted son and stepson, she wrote affectionately and often, though when angry, she could be harsh. She saw things in words, and liked to describe what she saw, heard and thought. Her letters are about the inner life, the excitements of youth and work and love affairs, the toughness of trying to write, the despair and loneliness of old age. Politics fascinated her: gossip did not. Malice, she would say, was not acceptable; hatred was. There are many references to American foreign policy, about which she was both highly critical and very apprehensive, long before the U.S.A. inspired alarm in others. It was soon after the war in Vietnam that Martha began warning about the rise of the Christian right and the dangers of American intervention in other parts of the world. A passionate liberal all her life and fired, from a very young age, by a strong sense of the injustice in the world, Martha could be impatient and intemperate over the question of Israel and the Palestinians; going into Dachau with the American army at the end of the Second World War had closed her mind forever against anything but the sanctity of an Israeli state, and many of her friends, both on paper and in conversation, preferred to avoid the subject. Apart from this, there were no taboos.<br>&nbsp;<br>There are many letters about books and writers, those she admired - Joseph Heller, Peter Matthiesen, Henry James, Trollope - and those who she could never come to grips with, like Proust. But above all, Martha's letters are about survival, about the struggles of life, how to keep going, how to do no harm to others and attain some degree of happiness oneself. "From the onset of observation until death," she told her stepson Sandy, "life is a problem for one who lives it." George Kennan once said to her that her letters were her "real genre, and it is where you yourself come through most genuinely and convincingly."<br>&nbsp;<br>The letters collected in this volume are a fraction of the number she wrote in her lifetime, many of them now held with her papers at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Center at Boston University. In order to include as many as possible, and to avoid repetition, I have cut, sometimes heavily, within the letters themselves. Major cuts are marked by dots; minor ones are not. One of her letters to David Gurewitsch, written over several days, runs to forty-seven typed pages; another, to Sandy Gellhorn, written over a month as a diary from Africa, to over thirty. In each case, I have selected just a few pages. Because Martha, particularly at the beginning of a friendship, often wrote letter after letter, day after day - exploring the limits of that friendship in a way more usual in a conversation than in a letter - I have included several examples, to illustrate how easy and pleasurable she found intimacy. Her letters to William Walton - briefly a lover but for many years a friend - in the 1940s and 1950s, and those to Betsy Drake in the 1970s and 1980s, belong to this category. Again, what appears here is only a fraction of what she wrote to them.<br>&nbsp;<br>Martha had an enormous number of friends. Though she told Rosamond Lehmann that her five closest friends had all been men, and that the world she loved was one of "men, and not the world of men and women," she became increasingly close to women as the years passed, and it was to them that many of her most revealing and intimate letters were written. Though she repeatedly professed contempt for self-analysis, and at times displayed a remarkable lack of self-awareness, few people have written so perceptively and with such candor about themselves.<br>&nbsp;<br>Martha's principal correspondents were: her mother Edna, to whom she wrote almost every day for forty years; Ernest Hemingway, with whom she lived on and off for eight years, though they were married for just four of them; Sandy Gellhorn, her adopted son, and Sandy Matthews, her stepson by her second husband, Tom Matthews; Hortense Flexner, who taught her at Bryn Mawr; Eleanor Roosevelt, who befriended her in 1936; Sybille Bedford, Betsy Drake, Lucy Moorehead, Diana Cooper, Robert Presnell, Leonard Bernstein, William Walton, George Paloczi-Horvath, and Moishe Pearlman; and, toward the end of her life, Victoria Glendinning, James Fox, Nicholas Shakespeare, and John Hatt. Many of them were given nicknames - Walton was Trolleycar, Hunk of Despair, Pieface; Hemingway, Bug, Pup-Pup, and even Mucklebugetski - though with her younger friends toward the end of her life she used terms of endearment. James Fox was "My favourite James in all the world." Affectionate and attentive with those she was fond of, Martha could also be unsentimental when they died. She dealt with partings and deaths with clarity, resignation, and a kind of brutality. When things ended - affairs, marriages, friendships - she packed, left, cut herself off, moved on. There was little looking back, few regrets. The only exceptions were her mother, whose death she mourned for the rest of her life, and her adopted son Sandy, about whom she worried constantly.<br>&nbsp;<br>When she sold her cottage in Wales, a few years before her death, Martha made a bonfire of some of her more personal letters. In those flames went virtually her entire correspondence with her mother, and her letters to Tom Matthews, James Gavin, and Laurence Rockefeller. I have been unable to trace her letters to Nadezhda Mandelstam, George Kennan, and John Pilger, all important correspondents.<br>&nbsp;<br>But most of the rest of her life - the wars, the books, the friends, the love affairs - is here, from the day when, at the age of twenty-two, she first arrived with her typewriter in Paris, excited, expectant, hungry for everything.<br>&nbsp;<br>This edited selection of Martha Gellhorn's letters copyright � 2006 by the Estate of Martha Gellhorn<br>Narrative and connective passages copyright � 2006 by Caroline Moorehead</p><h2>The Power of Music: Pioneering Discoveries in the New Science of Song</h2><p><p>The award-winning creator of the acclaimed documentary "The Music Instinct: Science &amp; Song," explores the power of music and its connection to the body, the brain, and the world of nature. Only recently has science sought in earnest to understand and explain this impact. One remarkable recent study, analyzing the cries of newborns, shows that infants' cries contain common musical intervals, and children tease each other in specific, singsong ways no matter where in the world they live. Physics experiments show that sound waves can physically change the structure of a material; musician and world-famous conductor Daniel Barenboim believes musical sound vibrations physically penetrate our bodies, shifting molecules as they do. The Power of Music follows visionary researchers and accomplished musicians to the crossroads of science and culture, to discover: how much of our musicality is learned and how much is innate? Can examining the biological foundations of music help scientists unravel the intricate web of human cognition and brain function? Why is music virtually universal across cultures and time-does it provide some evolutionary advantage? Can music make people healthier? Might music contain organzing principles of harmonic vibration that underlie the cosmos itself?</p></p><p><p><b>Elena Mannes </b>has won six Emmys and many other national awards for her documentaries.

Now she has brought that gift for storytelling to<i> The Power of Music</i>, laying out even for an untutored layman like me a captivating account of how music connects mind and body.

By the end of this fascinating story, Elena Mannes has led us to realize just how much we take music, its mysteries, and power for granted. This is a refreshing and exciting read that makes everything new again. If this book were required reading in every high school, we would start seeing generations of music scientists, and perhaps even better-equipped performers and audience members--which would naturally lead to music becoming a better-funded and respected subject in our schools than it currently is.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Deborah Voigt, internationally acclaimed opera soprano</i></p><p>&#x201c;We've always known that music is a transformative, spiritual experience--now modern science can explain how and why.

Within the year, the treaty signed that day, known as the Peace Pact, had been ratified by nearly every state in the world. War, for the first time in history, had become illegal the world over. But the promise of that summer day was fleeting. Within a decade of its signing, each state that had gathered in Paris to renounce war was <i>at war</i>. And in the century that followed, the Peace Pact was dismissed as an act of folly and an unmistakable failure. This book argues that that understanding is inaccurate, and that the Peace Pact ushered in a sustained march toward peace that lasts to this day.<br> <br><i>The Internationalists</i> tells the story of the Peace Pact by placing it in the long history of international law from the seventeenth century through the present, tracing this rich history through a fascinating and diverse array of lawyers, politicians and intellectuals&#x2014;Hugo Grotius, Nishi Amane, Salmon Levinson, James Shotwell, Sumner Welles, Carl Schmitt, Hersch Lauterpacht, and Sayyid Qutb. It tells of a centuries-long struggle of ideas over the role of war in a just world order. It details the brutal world of conflict the Peace Pact helped extinguish, and the subsequent era where tariffs and sanctions take the place of tanks and gunships.<br> <br><i>The Internationalists </i>examines with renewed appreciation an international system that has outlawed wars of aggression and brought unprecedented stability to the world map. Accessible and gripping, this book will change the way we view the history of the twentieth century&#x2014;and how we must work together to protect the global order the internationalists fought to make possible.</p><p>Oona A.

While this sci-fi/mystery mash-up has some plot inconsistencies and implausible moments, it will appeal to fans of the first two books. The four Virals-Tory, Shelton, Ben, and Hi-are well defined in the course of the story. Though they are all intelligent and protective of one another, their actions are not always prudent or legally sound. The group's "save the world" mentality thrusts them into plenty of perilous situations, and simply letting law enforcement handle the Gamemaster is never a real consideration. Still, the friends admirably stick together and will stop at nothing to protect the innocent.-Leigh Collazo, Ed Willkie Middle School, Fort Worth, TX&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Thus began a cinematic series unlike any other. In November 2012, <i>Skyfall,</i> the 23rd movie in what is seen as the authorized line of Bond films, will be released, with Daniel Craig (the sixth Bond) again in the lead role. The world will once more stream to the theaters for another dose of Bond. LIFE was on the scene in the swinging '60s when James Bond became a cultural icon (in fact, when we put the gold-painted actress Shirley Eaton on the cover in 1964, we helped him along), and now LIFE tells the whole story in this commemorative book. Ian Fleming, a high-ranking officer in British Naval Intelligence<b> </b>of World War II, dreamt up his MI6 spy, code number 007, in 1953, and a decade later, with <i>Dr. No, From Russia With Love</i> and then the smash <i>Goldfinger,</i> saw his creation take on a life entirely his own. All the fun of Bond is here: The movies; the reminiscences by the stars; the LIFE photo shoots; the knockoffs and spoofs ("The Man from U.N.C.L.E.;" "Get Smart;" "I Spy;" the first <i>Casino Royale</i>); the artifacts (a model of Bond's Aston Martin DB5 was one of the best-selling toy of 1965); the trivia and inside information on M, Q and Moneypenny-anything a Bond fan would want, packed into one book and then shaken, not stirred. James Bond was, back in the day, one of those cultural phenomena tailor-made for LIFE: It was bright and colorful and vibrant. Today, it still is. Happy birthday, and welcome back, Commander Bond.</p><p>The editors at LIFE vigorously carry on the traditions of excellence in photography, in journalism, and in telling the story of our country and our world which began with LIFE magazine in 1936 by founding editor and publisher, Henry R.

I enjoyed the change a great deal. The birchwood box and its contents that Annie discovers this time takes her on a quest for American Native information. This ultimately causes a disruption in one of the town&#39;s leading families. I could hardly believe the way this scenario was portrayed--adults acting as bad or worse than immature teenagers!

(DEED IN THE ATTIC) ( Amazon customer review)</p><p></p><h2>The Wasp Factory</h2><p>Frank, no ordinary sixteen-year-old, lives with his father outsIde a remote Scottish village. Their life is, to say the least, unconventional. Frank&#39;s mother abandoned them years ago: his elder brother Eric is confined to a psychiatric hospital; and his father measures out his eccentricities on an imperial scale. Frank has turned to strange acts of violence to vent his frustrations. In the bizarre daily rituals there is some solace. But when news comes of Eric&#39;s escape from the hospital Frank has to prepare the ground for his brother&#39;s inevitable return - an event that explodes the mysteries of the past and changes Frank utterly. Iain Banks&#39; celebrated first novel is a work of extraordinary originality, imagination and horrifying compulsion: horrifying, because it enters a mind whose realities are not our own, whose values of life and death are alien to our society; and compulsive, because the humour and compassion of that mind reach out to us all.</p><p><i>"I had been making the rounds of the Sacrifice Poles the day we heard my brother had escaped. I already knew something was going to happen; the Factory told me."</i> <p> Those lines begin one of the most infamous of contemporary Scottish novels. The narrator, Frank Cauldhame, is a weird teenager who lives on a tiny island connected to mainland Scotland by a bridge. He maintains grisly Sacrifice Poles to serve as his early warning system and deterrent against anyone who might invade his territory.</p><p> Few novelists have ever burst onto the literary scene with as much controversy as Iain Banks in 1984. <i>The Wasp Factory</i> was reviled by many reviewers on account of its violence and sadism, but applauded by others as a new and <i>Scottish</i> voice--that is, a departure from the English literary tradition. The controversy is a bit puzzling in retrospect, because there is little to object to in this novel, if you're familiar with genre horror.</p><p> <i>The Wasp Factory</i> is distinguished by an authentically felt and deftly written first-person style, delicious dark humor, a sense of the surreal, and a serious examination of the psyche of a childhood psychopath. Most readers will find that they sympathize with and even like Frank, despite his three murders (each of which is hilarious in an Edward Gorey fashion). It's a classic of contemporary horror. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Iain Banks came to widespread and controversial public notice with the publication of his first novel, THE WASP FACTORY, in 1984. He has been a hugely popular writer of fiction ever since, and, as Iain M Banks, of science fiction.</p><h2>The Beauty of Different: Observations of a Confident Misfit</h2><p>Constantly bombarded with messages on how to think, how to feel, how to look, it can be very easy to fall into the mindset that we somehow fail as individuals, that we are not enough.

Assuming her isolation to be the result of a military experiment gone awry, she begins the terrifying work of survival and self-renewal. This novel is at once a simple and moving tale and a disturbing meditation on humanity.</p><p>I can allow myself to write the truth; all the people for whom I have lied throughout my life are dead...&#x201d; writes the heroine of Marlen Haushofer&#x2019;s <i>The Wall</i>, a quite ordinary, unnamed middle-aged woman who awakens to find she is the last living person. Accompanied by her dog, she begins the terrifying work of survival, and eventually, self-renewal. <i>The Wall</i> is at once a simple and moving chronicle&#x2014;of growing potatoes and beans, of hoping for a calf, of counting matches, of forgetting the taste of sugar and the use of one&#x2019;s name and a disturbing meditation on 20th-century history. Now a major motion picture from Music Box Films, <i>The Wall</i> is a haunting study of what a person can love when everything has been taken away.MARLEN HAUSHOFER (1920-1970) was born in Frauenstein, a region in Upper Austria. She attended Catholic boarding school in Linz and studied German literature in Vienna and Graz. Her adult life was spent in Steyr, an old industrial city with a strong working class culture and a history of militancy. She published the novella <i>The Fifth Year</i> in 1952 and earned her first literary award in 1953. Her first novel, <i>A Handful of Life</i>, was published in 1955. <i>The Wall</i>, published in 1962, is considered her greatest literary achievement. Variously interpreted as an ironic Robinson Crusoe story, a philosophical parable of human isolation, and as dystopian fiction, <i>The Wall</i> is currently recognized for its important place in traditions of feminist fiction. Haushofers's last novel, <i>The Attic</i>, was published in 1969. Her last short story collection, <i>Terrible Faithfulness</i>, earned her the Austrian state prize for literature. She has been translated into several European languages, but <i>The Wall</i> is her only work available in English.</p><h2>Charlie Trotter&#39;s Seafood</h2><p><b>Chef Charlie Trotter has done it again, bringing his now-classic seafood recipes&#x2014;including tilapia, salmon, oysters, and shrimp&#x2014;from his award-winning restaurant to your kitchen</b><br><br>Charlie Trotter's Chicago restaurant is praised in the food press from coast to coast.

Included are more than 100 recipes using common and exotic fish, 75 evocative duotones that convey the drama of the fishing industry and grandeur of the fish themselves, and Trotter's signature larger-than-life photos of every dish.</p><p>Charlie Trotter's in Chicago is rated as one of the finest restaurants in the world. Eating there is a leisurely and memorable experience because Chef Trotter is endlessly creative and meticulously precise in his cooking. He uses the best ingredients and says one should do as little as possible to embellish them. Does he practice what he preaches? In your dreams!<p> The simplest of the 75 recipes in <i>Charlie Trotter's Seafood</i> are for dishes like Olive-Oil Roasted Swordfish with Oven-Roasted Tomato and Black Olives, and the Slow-Roasted Salmon with Red Wine Risotto, Wild Thyme and Tiny White Asparagus. His more typical, and even more breathtaking, creations are often based on Hawaiian fish, like Steamed Gindai and Mussels with Lemongrass Broth. On the plate these dishes are all as artistically arranged as they sound.</p><p> This is food pornography at its peak. Every dish, as exotic and complex as a lesson from the <i>Kama Sutra</i>, is shown in gloriously intimate, obscenely alluring, vinaigrette-dotted detail by photographer Tim Turner. Ambitious cooks will appreciate Trotter's recommended piscatorial substitutions. Finding other ingredients, like bleeding heart radishes and shallot blossoms, is up to you. Not to mention making time to produce the infused oils and deeply flavored stocks often called for. The recipes are grouped, unexpectedly, by the wines best for accompanying them. Trotter starts with champagne and proceeds through 16 other kinds of wine, from white Viognier to red Syrah and Barbera.</p><p> If complex, original cooking fascinates you, here is the chance to navigate an ocean of new seafood ideas and culinary combinations. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p>CHARLIE TROTTER is the author of 14 cookbooks and three management books and is an eight-time James Beard Award winner.

Beagle creates magic in this coming-of-age ghost story, returning to a subgenre he first explored in <i>A Fine and Private Place</i>. When her mother remarries, 13-year-old narrator Jenny Gluckstein moves from New York City to a run-down, haunted, 300-year-old farm in Dorset, England. In slow-moving early chapters, unhappy Jenny's beloved Mister Cat is quarantined for six months and she must attend an English girl's school. Jenny's voice is painfully genuine, her self-description merciless. If early adolescence brings on flashbacks, wait to read this book.<p> The pace picks up when Mister Cat returns and Jenny meets Meena Chari, whose belief in the supernatural comes from growing up in ghost-ridden India. First Mister Cat finds a new girlfriend, a ghostly Persian Cat only he and Jenny can see. Then she and her younger stepbrother, Julian, confront a boggart who's been playing tricks on the family. The gnome-like boggart is dressed in a Seven Dwarves hat, Robin Hood garb, "and heavy little boots, ankle-high--I'd have taken them for Doc Martens, except I don't think they make them in boggart sizes." The boggart warns her to beware of the ghost cat, her mistress, and "the Other One" most of all. But one afternoon she follows Mister Cat to meet Tamsin Willoughby, ghost of the farm-founder's daughter. Tamsin is friendly, but won't tell Jenny anything about the Other One, or talk about Edric, apparently her lost love. To free Tamsin's ghost, Jenny must relive the tragic history of 17th-century Dorset and face grave danger.</p><p> <i>Tamsin</i> is vintage Beagle: there's a shape-shifting Pooka, a ghostly love story, music, the Goddess, and the Wild Hunt. It's beautifully written and can be read on several levels, including as a loving homage to Thomas Hardy's moody novels (<i>Tess of the d'Urbervilles</i> and <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i>) and poetry (<i>Selected Poems</i>). Or you can lose yourself in the story. Fans of <i>The Last Unicorn</i> will enjoy this one. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p><b>Peter S. Beagle</b>, a World Fantasy Award nominee, is the bestselling author of the fantasy classic <b>The Last Unicorn</b> as well as many other highly acclaimed works.

There is an overall sense that they possess a deep and questing wisdom, hard earned through land work, travel, writing, and spiritual exploration. There is no rushing, no hectoring, and no grand gestures between these two, just an ever-deepening inquiry into what makes a good life and how to live it, even in the depths of the machine age." &#x2015;<i>Orion Magazine</i></b><br><br> <p>In 1969 Gary Snyder returned from a long residence in Japan to northern California, to a homestead in the Sierra foothills where he intended to build a house and settle on the land with his wife and young sons. He had just published his first book of essays, <i>Earth House</i> Hold. A few years before, after a long absence, Wendell Berry left New York City to return to land near his grandfather's farm in Port Royal, Kentucky, where he built a small studio and lived there with his wife as they restored an old house on their newly acquired homestead. In 1969 Berry had just published <i>Long-Legged House.</i> These two founding members of the counterculture and of the new environmental movement had yet to meet, but they knew each other's work, and soon they began a correspondence. Neither man could have imagined the impact their work would have on American political and literary culture, nor could they have appreciated the impact they would have on one another.</p> <p>Snyder had thrown over all vestiges of Christianity in favor of becoming a devoted Buddhist and Zen practitioner, and had lived in Japan for a prolonged period to develop this practice. Berry's discomfort with the Christianity of his native land caused him to become something of a renegade Christian, troubled by the church and organized religion, but grounded in its vocabulary and its narrative. Religion and spirituality seemed like a natural topic for the two men to discuss, and discuss they did. They exchanged more than 240 letters from 1973 to 2013, remarkable letters of insight and argument. The two bring out the best in each other, as they grapple with issues of faith and reason, discuss ideas of home and family, worry over the disintegration of community and commonwealth, and share the details of the lives they've chosen to live with their wives and children. Contemporary American culture is the landscape they reside on. Environmentalism, sustainability, global politics and American involvement, literature, poetry and progressive ideals, these two public intellectuals address issues as broad as are found in any exchange in literature.</p> <p>No one can be unaffected by the complexity of their relationship, the subtlety of their arguments, and the grace of their friendship. This is a book for the ages.</p></p><p><b>Wendell Berry</b> continues to live and work with his wife, Tanya Berry, on their hillside farm in Kentucky.<br><br><b>Gary Snyder</b> still lives on his homestead in the Sierra foothills, and is a neighbor and community activist in the Yuba River Watershed.<br><br><b>Chad Wriglesworth</b> is Assistant Professor of English at St. Jerome&#x2019;s University in the University of Waterloo.<br>"Candid, introspective and often deeply philosophical, these letters offer intimate glimpses into the lives and minds of two influential contemporary writers." <i>Kirkus</i><br><br>"The letters are valuable for ecologists, students and teachers of contemporary American literature and for those of us eager to know how these two distant neighbors networked, negotiated and remained friends." <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>"[...] distills the decades-long flourishing of a remarkable friendship and documents the careers of two important living American writers, natural philosophers, and conservationists." <i>Publishers Weekly</i> Starred Review<br><br>"<i>Distant Neighbors: the Selected Letters of Wendell Berry and Gary Snyder</i>...showcases these two great American poet-philosophers at most thoughtful and least guarded.

Paul Kingsnorth's pick for one of <i>New Stateman's</i> Books of the Year<br><br>"Both poets and essayists have written extensively on ecology and our relationship with the natural environment. But their correspondence reveals as many points of difference - of opinion, of region, of background - as similarity, and lively and thoughtful dialogue on many topics, along with fellowship and a reverence for art and authenticity, is the result." -NPR<br><br>"Make no mistake: the melding and morphing of ideas that editor Chad Wriglesworth brings to the pages of <i>Distant Neighbors</i> will, for most readers, be the main appeal of the book. But these small, more literally grounded concerns, the tiny details of a day spent in Henry County, Kentucky, or in the foothills of the Sierras, are shining threads in the cloth of this long, good friendship. It&#x2019;s news like Berry&#x2019;s one spring that he and his wife Tanya have three rows in the garden and 35 lambs&#x201d; or Snyder&#x2019;s enthusiastic recommendation of his sister&#x2019;s book on the chicken farms of Petaluma, that keeps the two writers tethered to the warp and woof of their shared sense of place and time. Over and over in these pages the authors rise up to the big, mythical arenas of human existence, then float back down to the simple comforts of the mundane. Such is the feast that feeds them. And as a reader of these letters, it&#x2019;s hard not to feel terribly fortunate to be seated at the table."

One and only one. My arrest and my testimony. I went up there and visited with him two or three times. Three times. The last time was the day of his execution. I didnt have to go but I did. I sure didnt want to. He&#x2019;d killed a fourteen year old girl and I can tell you right now I never did have no great desire to visit with him let alone go to his execution but I done it. The papers said it was a crime of passion and he told me there wasnt no passion to it. He&#x2019;d been datin this girl, young as she was. He was nineteen. And he told me that he had been plannin to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him out he&#x2019;d do it again. Said he knew he was goin to hell. Told it to me out of his own mouth. I dont know what to make of that. I surely dont. I thought I&#x2019;d never seen a person like that and it got me to wonderin if maybe he was some new kind. I watched them strap him into the seat and shut the door. He might of looked a bit nervous about it but that was about all. I really believe that he knew he was goin to be in hell in fifteen minutes. I believe that. And I&#x2019;ve thought about that a lot. He was not hard to talk to. Called me Sheriff. But I didnt know what to say to him. What do you say to a man that by his own admission has no soul? Why would you say anything? I&#x2019;ve thought about it a good deal. But he wasnt nothin compared to what was comin down the pike.<br><br> They say the eyes are the windows to the soul. I dont know what them eyes was the windows to and I guess I&#x2019;d as soon not know. But there is another view of the world out there and other eyes to see it and that&#x2019;s where this is goin. It has done brought me to a place in my life I would not of thought I&#x2019;d of come to. Somewhere out there is a true and living prophet of destruction and I dont want to confront him. I know he&#x2019;s real. I have seen his work. I walked in front of those eyes once. I wont do it again. I wont push my chips forward and stand up and go out to meet him. It aint just bein older. I wish that it was. I cant say that it&#x2019;s even what you are willin to do. Because I always knew that you had to be willin to die to even do this job. That was always true. Not to sound glorious about it or nothin but you do. If you aint they&#x2019;ll know it. They&#x2019;ll see it in a heartbeat. I think it is more like what you are willin to become. And I think a man would have to put his soul at hazard. And I wont do that. I think now that maybe I never would.<br><br> The deputy left Chigurh standing in the corner of the office with his hands cuffed behind him while he sat in the swivelchair and took off his hat and put his feet up and called Lamar on the mobile.<br><br> Just walked in the door.

He dropped his cuffed hands over the deputy&#x2019;s head and leaped into the air and slammed both knees against the back of the deputy&#x2019;s neck and hauled back on the chain.<br><br> They went to the floor. The deputy was trying to get his hands inside the chain but he could not. Chigurh lay there pulling back on the bracelets with his knees between his arms and his face averted. The deputy was flailing wildly and he&#x2019;d begun to walk sideways over the floor in a circle, kicking over the wastebasket, kicking the chair across the room. He kicked shut the door and he wrapped the throwrug in a wad about them. He was gurgling and bleeding from the mouth. He was strangling on his own blood. Chigurh only hauled the harder. The nickelplated cuffs bit to the bone. The deputy&#x2019;s right carotid artery burst and a jet of blood shot across the room and hit the wall and ran down it. The deputy&#x2019;s legs slowed and then stopped. He lay jerking. Then he stopped moving altogether. Chigurh lay breathing quietly, holding him. When he got up he took the keys from the deputy&#x2019;s belt and released himself and put the deputy&#x2019;s revolver in the waistband of his trousers and went into the bathroom.<br><br> He ran cold water over his wrists until they stopped bleeding and he tore strips from a handtowel with his teeth and wrapped his wrists and went back into the office. He sat on the desk and fastened the toweling with tape from a dispenser, studying the dead man gaping up from the floor. When he was done he got the deputy&#x2019;s wallet out of his pocket and took the money and put it in the pocket of his shirt and dropped the wallet to the floor. Then he picked up his airtank and the stungun and walked out the door and got into the deputy&#x2019;s car and started the engine and backed around and pulled out and headed up the road.<br><br> On the interstate he picked out a late model Ford sedan with a single driver and turned on the lights and hit the siren briefly. The car pulled onto the shoulder. Chigurh pulled in behind him and shut off the engine and slung the tank across his shoulder and stepped out. The man was watching him in the rearview mirror as he walked up.<br><br> What&#x2019;s the problem, officer? he said.<br><br> Sir would you mind stepping out of the vehicle?<br><br> The man opened the door and stepped out. What&#x2019;s this about? he said.<br><br> Would you step away from the vehicle please.<br><br> The man stepped away from the vehicle. Chigurh could see the doubt come into his eyes at this bloodstained figure before him but it came too late. He placed his hand on the man&#x2019;s head like a faith healer. The pneumatic hiss and click of the plunger sounded like a door closing. The man slid soundlessly to the ground, a round hole in his forehead from which the blood bubbled and ran down into his eyes carrying with it his slowly uncoupling world visible to see. Chigurh wiped his hand with his handkerchief. I just didnt want you to get blood on the car, he said.<br><br> Moss sat with the heels of his boots dug into the volcanic gravel of the ridge and glassed the desert below him with a pair of twelve power german binoculars. His hat pushed back on his head. Elbows propped on his knees. The rifle strapped over his shoulder with a harnessleather sling was a heavybarreled .270 on a &#x2019;98 Mauser action with a laminated stock of maple and walnut. It carried a Unertl telescopic sight of the same power as the binoculars. The antelope were a little under a mile away. The sun was up less than an hour and the shadow of the ridge and the datilla and the rocks fell far out across the floodplain below him. Somewhere out there was the shadow of Moss himself. He lowered the binoculars and sat studying the land. Far to the south the raw mountains of Mexico. The breaks of the river. To the west the baked terracotta terrain of the run- ning borderlands. He spat dryly and wiped his mouth on the shoulder of his cotton workshirt.<br><br> The rifle would shoot half minute of angle groups. Five inch groups at one thousand yards. The spot he&#x2019;d picked to shoot from lay just below a long talus of lava scree and it would put him well within that distance. Except that it would take the better part of an hour to get there and the antelope were grazing away from him. The best he could say about any of it was that there was no wind.<br><br> When he got to the foot of the talus he raised himself slowly and looked for the antelope. They&#x2019;d not moved far from where he last saw them but the shot was still a good seven hundred yards. He studied the animals through the binoculars. In the compressed air motes and heat distortion. A low haze of shimmering dust and pollen. There was no other cover and there wasnt going to be any other shot.<br><br> He wallowed down in the scree and pulled off one boot and laid it over the rocks and lowered the forearm of the rifle down into the leather and pushed off the safety with his thumb and sighted through the scope.<br><br> They stood with their heads up, all of them, looking at him.<br><br> Damn, he whispered. The sun was behind him so they couldnt very well have seen light reflect off the glass of the scope. They had just flat seen him.<br><br> The rifle had a Canjar trigger set to nine ounces and he pulled the rifle and the boot toward him with great care and sighted again and jacked the crosshairs slightly up the back of the animal standing most broadly to him. He knew the exact drop of the bullet in hundred yard increments. It was the distance that was uncertain. He laid his finger in the curve of the trigger. The boar&#x2019;s tooth he wore on a gold chain spooled onto the rocks inside his elbow.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Memories of Silk and Straw: A Self-Portrait of Small-Town Japan</h2><p>Over 50 reminiscences of pre-modern Japan-illustrations of a way of life that has virtually disappeared. Voted "Best Book of the Year" by Japan's foreign press.<br><br>This is a collective biography, based on interviews taped by a small-town doctor, recording the lives of a cotton dyer, blacksmith, tofu maker, undertaker, carter, tenant farmer, local gangster, casual laborer, horse-meat butcher, magistrate's wife, apprentice geisha, rice merchant, thatcher, carpenter, midwife, county hangman, pawnbroker, draper, fisherman, hairdresser, servant, charcoal burner, and so on-over fifty in all. Their memories are all related to a lakeside town and its rural suburbs northeast of Tokyo.<br><br>Born in the early years of this century, these people have both seen the old Japan and lived through the changes brought about by modernization and the onset of affluence. In a real sense, they provide the sole surviving links with a feudal way of life and its attitudes which have altered, in the space of fifty years or so, beyond recognition.<br><br>Through plain-spoken anecdote-their voices by turns amused, nostalgic, disturbing but unsensational-they describe their youth in a tougher world where poverty was commonplace, where unwanted children were sometimes "thinned out'' at birth, where poorer families cooked out-of-doors and fishermen in summer went almost naked. By saving their memories for posterity, the author hoped to close, just a fraction, the gap in perception between a traditional past and the Japan we know today. The result-as the distinguished anthropologist, Ronald Dore, says in his preface-is "a book to savor, and a book to learn from."<br><br>These reminiscences are accompanied by illustrations painted by the author's father, Dr. Susumu Saga-themselves a record of an old man's past.</p><p><br>JUNICHI SAGA, is a graduate of Keio University in medicine, with a practice in Tsuchiura, Ibaragi Prefecture-the focus of this book.

The encounter is at Miami's morgue, where the unidentified stranger lies dead. His unusual old scars capture her curiosity-the dead man clearly had a tale to tell. This thief, who was accidentally electrocuted, may be the key that unlocks the long-sought secrets of a sensational cold murder mystery unsolved for more than fourteen years.</p><p>Sunny and Ricky, teenagers on a Christmas Eve first date, were abducted, a shocking crime that was never solved despite a gigantic manhunt, a huge reward, and an outraged community. Frustrated police called the lack of leads eerie. Unnatural. Against all the laws of homicide and human nature. Now Britt wants the story, and she isn't the only one seeking answers.</p><p>Sunny survived, the lone witness to that terrible night so long ago. But the reclusive Ice Maiden, now an artist and sculptor estranged from her wealthy family, is not talking and the killer's trail vanished long ago, like footprints in melting snow.</p><p>Cold Case Squad Sargeant Craig Burch wants the killer. But as the Miami News reporter and the veteran homicide cop investigate the old outrage, they learn that sometimes the cost of justice is too high.</p><p>When you start to turn over rocks, something ugly sometimes slithers out. Monstrous evil from the past emerges to overtake a whole new generation of innocent victims as deadly passions are reawakened and mortal fears resurface.</p><p>For Burch, whose elite unit breathes new life into cold murder cases, the investigation strikes too close to home, reigniting his own private obsessions. And Britt, in the wake of national tragedy, is haunted, both awake and asleep, by the persistent ghost of a doomed, lost girl, perhaps a warning of a new tragedy to come. Britt meets the Ice Maiden, nearly freezes to death, and then the trail heats up as the sins of the fathers begin to strike down the innocent. A stone-cold killer out of her past is stalking the Ice Maiden again. Nothing is what it seems. And the inferno is yet to come....</p><p>Edna Buchanan, a born storyteller, combines her trademark wit, grit, and tension in <em>The Ice Maiden,</em> a narrative alive with Miami's blistering heat and high-octane atmosphere.</p></p><p>Miami crime reporter Britt Montero, the Cuban American with Latin passion and Yankee perseverance, gets involved with members of the Cold Case task force that's reopened an old case involving the murder of a high school senior and the rape and near-death of his girlfriend, who's now a sculptor with an unusual specialty--ice carving. Unmasking the killers requires Sunny Hartley's cooperation, but even Britt's blandishments can't convince her to help the task force bring her attackers and her boyfriend's murderers to justice. And it doesn't help any that the head of the force, who has her own reasons for pulling her men off the investigation, seems to have something romantic going with homicide cop Kendall MacDonald, Britt's old (but hardly forgotten) lover. As usual, Edna Buchanan delivers a denouement that's full of bittersweet tricks and turns in this latest outing for her popular series heroine. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Edna Buchanan knows firsthand that underneath Miami&#39;s glistening facade lies a city torn by violence and muddied by corruption, where every moment a crime is waiting to happen. As a Pulitzer Prize-winning crime reporter, Buchanan has exposed the seamier sides of this sun-drenched paradise, then used her more than twenty years of experience to create a dynamic and deadly Miami that vividly comes alive in each of her novels. Especially when the city is seen through the fiercely intense eyes of a tough newspaperwoman named Britt Montero. The author of eleven books, Buchanan has spent time behind bars -- with two serial killers.

Back in the 1970s and early 1980s, you could hear the dark mutterings in women's health collectives and alternative bookstores across the country: Society kept any serious discussion of a woman's monthly cycle locked away in a figurative hut of superstition, sexism, and ignorance, far away from men, children, and the rest of polite society.But of course, that was then, this is now. These days, what subject isn't talked about in broad daylight, right out loud--not only at home and at work, but on TV, in so-called family movies, on your very computer as you sit there innocently surfing the Web? It's quite possible, in one not very exciting day at home, to stumble upon detailed descriptions and actual videos that explicitly refer to not only menstruation but numerous other bodily parts and functions that would make even your hard-boiled, tough-talking Aunt Freida blush.Menstruation is everywhere! Why, in 2007, they even ran a nationwide commercial promoting menstrual suppression right before the Oscars, for Pete's sake! Check out the commercials on daytime programming, pick up any magazine aimed at women or teenage girls. It's like the tampons and pads are practically leaping off the screen and out of the pages to get at you! If there really was any kind of taboo against menstruation, it's a thing of the distant past, isn't it?Well, yes ... and no.The catch--and it's a big one--is that whenever menstruation is mentioned these days, it's only because there's an underlying sales pitch. Either that, or it's the subject of a complaint or the punch line to a joke. Or all of the above. There's no real discussion of the actual event itself--not just the physiology and hormones of menstruation, but its complex history, its place in society, the inescapable role it plays in every woman's life, and its ramifications for our health, the environment, and our lives. (And we're sorry, no matter what any fifteen-year-old tells you, vulgarity alone does not count as honest discourse.)The sad fact is that menstruation--the process, the images, the word itself--is as unspeakable and undercover as it ever was. Think about it--even in movies, TV shows, and commercials that actually mention menstruation by name, you never, ever see any sign of it. In fact, although you can watch buckets of fake blood merrily sploodging out of heads and torsos because of fists, bullets, knives, car accidents, grenades, bombs, breaking glass, garrotes, machetes, falling buildings, swords, laser beams, airline crashes, or hungry mutant zombies, rarely will you ever see a single drop as a result of menstruation. In 1995, a Village Voice cover featured a tasteful photo of a naked woman in profile, with a white string nonchalantly dangling between her thighs (the article was on Toxic Shock Syndrome), and from the subsequent outcry from readers, you would have thought the paper had endorsed Satan for president. (And this is theVillage Voice we're talking about, the paper that has routinely covered everything from genital piercing to golden showers.)Even in the most up-to-date print ad or TV commercial, you will never once see a menstrual product being unwrapped, applied, inserted, tugged at, yanked out, pulled off, wadded up, wrapped in toilet paper, flushed, or thrown away--God forbid showing a before-and-after shot of a tampon (now that's a memorable visual!) or what it looks like when you accidentally spring a leak. The ads don't even show the inside of a bathroom, which is weird, considering that's where most tampons and pads are inserted or applied in the first place.<i>Whenever menstruation is mentioned these days, it's only because there's an underlying sales pitch</i>.The accompanying ad copy is invariably as bloodless as the images--neutral, soothing, and maddeningly vague. You can stare endlessly at a print ad featuring a beautiful woman walking across a field in a flowy gown, ponder the tagline "fresh, free, and natural"until your head feels like it's going to explode, and still come away not knowing what the hell they're selling: Is it air freshener? A new line of hemp clothing? A timeshare in the Poconos?The first time the word "period"was even mentioned in the entire history of TV advertising was in a Tampax commercial starring, funnily enough, Courteney Cox Arquette--and that wasn't until 1985! The Red Dot campaign by Kotex was the first to use the words "period" and "red," and that rabble-rousing piece of subversion didn't even occur until 2000.Yet despite the ad world's contorted attempts not to show or say anything that could be seen as even remotely scandalous or off-putting, their efforts are apparently still not enough for most people. From what we can tell, public attitudes haven't changed much at all over the decades; as a result, menstrual ads have remained so incredibly sterilized and unspecific, you could look at them and honestly not even realize human blood was involved.And it's not just a problem with advertising. Our language itself has essentially been purged of menstruation, like there's been some kind of creepy propaganda campaign forcing us to discuss it (if we do at all) in a mysterious code known only to CIA operatives. If you don't believe us, take a moment to consider the many, many ways we all refer to menstruation.You're on the Rag. Your Friend's in Town, or maybe it's your Aunt Flo Who's Come to Visit, or your Aunt Ruby, or, for the sports-minded, the Red Sox Have a Home Game. Expressions for menstruation range from the jaunty (Saddling Up Old Rusty, the Tomato Boat Has Come In, a Visit from Cap'n Bloodsnatch) to the descriptive and occasionally gross (the Bleedies, the Dam Has Burst). There's also the essentially grim and resigned (the Curse, the Crud, the Misery, Monthly Trouble, the Nuisance, Being Unwell, Out of Commission).Hey, it's always fun to complain, especially if it's about something inevitable (taxes, jury duty, that weird skin under your chin once you hit forty). Humor, after all, is the time-honored way we deal with discomfort, anxiety, and fear. What fits the bill better than menstruation? Even if you're a perfectly well-adjusted, in-your-body kind of gal, who can resist telling her friends she's like Picasso in His Red Period or that she's Riding the Big Red Cadillac Down the Avenue of Womanhood?There are creative film references for the pop culturists out there (Taking Carrie to the Prom, Miss Scarlett's Come Home to Tara), as well as endless uses of the word "red" (Code Red, Wearing the Red Badge of Courage, Off Visiting the Red Planet, Riding the Red Tide, Driving Through the Redwood Forest). If you're Having Ketchup with Your Steak, you might have to Walk Like an Egyptian or go Ram a Tam; if the Communists Have Invaded the Summer House, you probably need to go Change Your Cooter Plug or Straddle a Pad.Look, we enjoy a good laugh as much as the next gal. Yet what freaks us out is that beneath all the bonhomie lurks the very real and unspoken message that as much as we're encouraged to make light about menstruation, we're somehow not supposed to be talking about it seriously. Is it just us, or don't you find it sinister when, say, a female lawyer in her thirties who can usually discuss anything from the G-8 summit to Etruscan pottery coyly lets slip that It's Arts and Crafts Week at Panty Camp?And in case you were wondering, this isn't just the crazy, puritanical ol' US of A we're talking about here. Even those hip, sexy, sophisticated countries you think would be so over body shame have jokey expressions for the whole process. Worldwide, we've lost count, but we think there are currently about sixty trillion euphemisms for menstruation.In the Netherlands, you might say De Tomatensoep Is Overgekookt (the Tomato i Soup Is Overcooked); if you're Brazilian, it might be Estou com Chico (I'm with Chico); if you're Chinese, it's Little Sister Has Come; in Latin America, Jenny Has a Red Dress On; in Australia, I've Got the Flags Out; in Denmark, Der Er Kommunister i Lysthuset (There Are Communists in the Funhouse); in Ireland, I'm Wearing a Jam Rag.People around the world have apparently taken to creative euphemizing with the zest of game show contestants. In England, there's I'm Flying the Japanese Flag (get out your Flags of the World placemat if this one eludes you); in Japan there's Ichigo-chan (Little Miss Strawberry); in France, Les Anglais Sont Arrives! (The English Have Arrived, presumably in their traditional red coats). In Germany, it's Die Waldbeerfrau Kommit (the Cranberry WomanIs Coming) or Ihren Kram Haben (Have Your Trash); in Puerto Rico they ask, �Te Cant� el Gallo? (Did the Rooster Already Sing?). In South Africa, Granny's Stuck in Traffic. And in Finland, PMS is charmingly referred to as Hullun Lechman Tauti, or mad cow disease.FIVE THINGS WE DIDN'T KNOW BEFORE WE WROTE THIS BOOK1. Your period on the Pill isn't really a period.2. Doctors once stimulated patients to clitoral orgasms as treatment for hysteria.3. Bloodletting came about to mimic menstruation, which was seen as a way to relieve bodies of noxious blood.4. Hormone replacement drugs are made from the urine of pregnant mares.5. There's a thriving menstrual porn industry.Despite the humor and even the occasional grossness used to describe this most basic of female functions, what's actually taboo is any serious discussion of menstruation. If you don't believe us, just try this experiment: stroll into your next dinner party, family cookout, postwork happy hour--anywhere there's a reasonable mix of men and women, young and old--and try striking up a serious group conversation about, say, dioxin in tampons and its possible link to endometriosis. Watch as the faces around you swiftlyturn to stone, as elderly relatives start to choke on the three-bean salad, as mothers whisk the kids away, as the menfolk get that strained look we know so well. Skirts will be drawn aside, and voil�! In a New York minute you will have become persona non grata.Now, why is this?We're not being annoyingly na�ve here, so please bear with us. To you, this may seem like a weird question because the answer is so obvious. Nobody talks about menstruation because it's so, well, inherently distasteful. Plus, it's personal. Right? To many if not most women, a serious discussion about one's monthly flow in polite society is about as much of a conversational nonstarter as religion, how much money people make, and an in-depth analysis of one's genital warts.Yet we have the sneaking suspicion that these seemingly unshakeable convictions of ours actually arise from centuries of calculated shame, moderated by money--with a dash of internalized objectification thrown in for good measure--as well as a genuine, centuries-old fear and suspicion of female body processes.Paranoid? Who, us? Like flat-earthers laughing at crazy old Christopher Columbus who was so obviously about to go sailing off the edge of that ocean, many women may find it hard to believe that we all in fact have swallowed a line so completely that we can't even imagine life without it. And yet, bear with us a second as we mull this further.In her book The Curse: Confronting the Last Unmentionable Taboo: Menstruation, Karen Houppert makes the point that even in these supposedly modern times, menstruation is always referred to with depressing, loser-ish verbs ("decay," "shred," "shrink," "slough," "disintegrate," "dribbles," "discharge"), whereas ejaculation gets all the sexy, empowered, action-hero verbs (like "spurt," "spray," "pump," "shoot"). Be honest--with verbs like those, if you had to be a biological process, which would you rather choose? Even textbooks and gynecological literature make menstruation seem so, well, dweeby and passive: that what's actually going on, far from being the dynamic, incredibly complex process it is, is instead vaguely pathetic. We are left with the impression that the sad-sack uterus (pun intended) has once again not been asked to the pregnancy prom, so it just stays at home and lets it all go--that menstruation is, essentially, a lame combination of inertia and failure.Language illustrates a basic tension: that people may talk about menstruation, but only when they reduce it somehow, dismissing it as the disgusting, eye-rolling nuisance everyone agrees it is. Periods are thus perceived as a dreary thing that happens to us--and not a complex and active process that is actually an integral part of our breathing, sweating, digesting, thinking bodies.The underlying problem is something that the canny French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir put her nicotine-stained finger on in her groundbreaking 1949 book, The Second Sex: that in a world pretty much defined and dominated by men, women are seen as nothing more than the "other" sex, existing relative to the guys. Therefore, we stare with dismay at our own bodies, the way a landscaper might when faced with an especially unpromising patch of weedy, rocky, lumpy ground that must be ruthlessly weed-whacked into shape. Ever critical of the nagging unpredictabilities of our bodies, we're beset by anxiety, knowing we're supposed to be clean, dainty, and in control--and periods (All that blood and bloating! Those cramps! Such a temper!) are anything but.So how does language fit into all of this?In every conversation we have, the words we use to describe our bodies and their processes not only reflect but actually reinforce how we feel about them and how other people perceive them. This is why certain spokespeople get to go on the lecture circuit and make tons of dough talking about the power of positive talk ... because it's actually true. The same is true for negative language. If, say, you decide to introduce a new proposal at the office with, "Here's another bad idea you're gonna think really sucks," chances are pretty good you've already shot yourself in the foot.What makes all of this especially sinister is when we suddenly realize (like in our favorite scary story when the babysitter realizes the killer is actually calling from upstairs!) that the words we use, along with all their associations, have been already chosen for us years ago, in some cases even centuries ago. And by not questioning the words we've been programmed to use, we have indirectly absorbed their witchy power.Consider the word "hysteria." A rampantly popular diagnosis for centuries, it comes from the Greek word hystera, or "uterus." The ancient Greek doctor Hippocrates (ca. 460 B.C. to 370 B.C.), normally such a swift guy that he was known as the father of medicine, seriously believed that the hystera was wont to wander around a woman'sbody. We're not kidding; he thought the uterus literally liked to mosey around a woman's torso, into her chest, and sometimes right up into her throat, in its never-ending search for children. Those ramblin' ways allegedly caused hysteria, a supposed illness that was still being diagnosed in women up until the early twentieth century.In terms of language, there were no separate words for female genitalia for thousands of years. That was mostly because women were considered pretty much the same as men, only of course flimsier, more poorly designed, and incapable of writing in the snow. As a result, people used the same words to describe male and female organs: the ovaries were considered the female ...</p><h2>Art of Freddy (Freddy Books)</h2><p>Walter Brooks&#39;s Freddy the Pig first appeared in print in 1927, in To andAgain (later published as Freddy Goes to Florida). Devotees and acclaimsoon followed, as did the winning relationship between Brooks and illustrator Kurt Wiese. The result was twenty-six Freddy books in all, each accompanied by Wiese&#39;s vibrant and comic illustrations. As Brooks once said, &#34;Kurt Wiese draws such very sympathetic pigs!&#34; Celebrating the seventy-fifth anniversary is this delightful volume of Kurt Wiese&#39;s illustrations, capturing the incomparable Freddy in his many guises-as detective, poet, banker, and pilot, just to name a few! Here, too, are Freddy&#39;s adventures and misadventures, his human and barnyard friends and foes. Together with choice bits of Brooks&#39;s text, Kurt Wiese&#39;s illustrations capture the rollicking humor and dramatic spirit of Freddy&#39;s world. Included, too, are several exciting original Freddy illustrations-never before in print from the collection of Lee Secrest, former president of Friends of Freddy, and keeper of the Freddy archives. An introduction by Michael Cart, one of the foremost authorities on all things Freddy puts Kurt Wiese&#39;s life and art into context with Freddy and his creator, Walter Brooks.</p><p>Walter R. Brooks (1886-1958) was born in Rome, New York. He worked for several magazines including The New Yorker and his short stories were published in the Saturday Evening Post, the Atlantic Monthly, and Esquire ."Ed Takes the Pledge" was the basis for the 1960s television series, Mr. Ed but Brooks&#x2019;s most lasting achievement is the Freddy the Pig series, which began in 1927 with To and Again (Freddy Goes to Florida). He subsequently wrote twenty-five more delightful books starring Freddy, "that charming, ingenious pig" (The New York Times).Before chapter books and easy-to-read books, children made the transition from picture books to novels through the liberally illustrated, episodic adventures of engaging characters. Many children of the '30s, '40s, and '50s learned to love reading because of Freddy the Pig and his Bean Farm friends, 26 animal fantasies written by Brooks and illustrated by Wiese. In his introduction, Cart concludes that "[Wiese's] pictures do more than simply illustrate the words of the text; they expand them and immeasurably enrich the reader's experience of the books." This 75th-anniversary volume includes 200 illustrations and text fragments from the books, supported by Cart's assessment. The topical organization-disguises, moods, food, villains, etc.-cuts across the art published between 1927 and 1958, so the variations of line and Freddy's shifting "maturity" add interest to the large, open page design. A 24-page color section showcases the cover art for each title. There is no list of sources for each selection, no analysis of Wiese's style, and no essay of historical context. Rather, as Cart says, this book is, "simply put, a feast for the eye." The "Freddy" books are now back in print, so there will be both old and new fans interested in this celebration, but this book also has a place in academic libraries serving students of illustration and the history of children's literature.<br><i>Sue Burgess, Framingham State College, MA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Kirchner</h2><p><strong>A radical innovator, a pioneer of new artistic form</strong> &nbsp; German expressionist painter and graphic artist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880-1938), co-founder of the Br�cke movement, produced some of the most outstanding woodcuts and powerful expressionist works of the 20th century.

Long before Ragweed finds his way to Dimwood Forest and to Poppy, he leaves his family and serene country home behind and sets off by train for the big city, a place fraught with cars, buses, music, pleasure, excitement, attitude and danger--chiefly in the form of cats!<p> Silversides, for instance, is an urbane specimen in a pink polyvinyl collar studded with diamond-like sequins. Founder and president of F.E.A.R.(Felines Enraged About Rodents), an organization dedicated to keeping cats on top, people in the middle, and mice on the bottom. Silversides and club vice president Graybar, stalks her prey relentlessly.</p><p> Ragweed befriends hipster band members Clutch, Dipstick and Lugnut as well as Blinker, a timid and vulnerable pet-store mouse. Through these friends, he discovers a world where courage and loyalty are the keys to survival. In so doing, Ragweed learns to trust himself and take charge of his destiny.</p><p> Together the mice transform an abandoned bookstore into a cool new club, the Cafe Independent, and plan a blowout--and cat-free--opening night. But with Silversides and Graybar prowling the sewers, just how long can their independence last?</p></p><p><p>Avi is the author of more than sixty books, including <em>Crispin: The Cross of Lead</em>, a Newbery Medal winner, and <em>Crispin: At the Edge of the World</em>. His other acclaimed titles include <em>The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle</em> and <em>Nothing But the Truth</em>, both Newbery Honor Books, and most recently <em>The Seer of Shadows</em>. He lives with his family in Colorado. </p>Grade 3-6-Ragweed, the golden mouse who appeared briefly in Poppy (Orchard, 1995) before being devoured by an owl, gets an entire book to himself in this prequel. At an early age, he sets off to explore the world beyond the Brook, so he hitches a train and ends up in the town of Amperville. Unfortunately, a fierce house cat named Silversides has created an organization called Felines Enraged About Rodents (F.E.A.R.), and is trying to rid the town of all mice. Ragweed is saved from Silversides's claws by Clutch, a streetwise young mouse who dyes her head fur green, wears an earring, and plays in a rock band. As F.E.A.R. becomes more and more of a threat, Ragweed and Clutch hatch a plan to unite the town mice at their new club, the Caf? Independent, where they stand up against the cats and win. After this victory, however, Ragweed's wanderlust compels him to leave Amperville and travel onward...to Dimswood Forest. Fun and breezy, this adventure should appeal to fans of the series and newcomers as well. It does bog down whenever the focus goes from Ragweed and his friends to the bitter Silversides, and kids probably won't be interested in Clutch's stereotypically bohemian parents (an artist and a poet). The constant slangy jive-talking of Clutch and her pals ("Look, when I say cool, I mean, you know, like, it's good") will either irritate or amuse readers, but the thrilling climax at the Caf? Independent will leave them breathless.<br><i>Eva Mitnick, Los Angeles Public Library </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>EXODUS.

More than twenty years have passed since Brooks set the new standard for the genre with his astonishing first novel, The Sword of Shannara, the now-classic commencement of a centuries-spanning epic of good and evil. Now Brooks embarks on what promises to be his masterpiece--Ilse Witch: Book One of The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara.<br><br>When the mutilated body of a half-drowned elf is found floating in the seas of the Blue Divide, an old mystery resurfaces. Thirty years ago, the elven prince Kael Elessedil--brother to the current king--led an expedition in search of a legendary magic said to be more ancient, more powerful, than any in the world. Of all those who set out on that ill-fated voyage, not one has ever returned . . .<br><br>Until now. For the rescued elf carries a map covered with mysterious symbols only one man has the skill to decipher. That man is Walker Boh, the last of the Druids. But someone else understands the map's significance, someone dark and ruthless: the Ilse Witch, a beautiful but twisted young woman who wields a magic as potent as his own. She will stop at nothing to possess the map--and the magic it leads to. To stop her, Walker must find the magic first.<br><br>So begins the voyage of the Jerle Shannara. Aboard the sleek, swift airship are an elven prince; a Rover girl; a monstrous creature part man, part enigma; and a young man named Bek Rowe, who may unknowingly hold the key to the success of the mission--or to its cataclysmic failure. Now, as old secrets come to light, sowing seeds of mistrust and suspicion among the crew, the Jerle Shannara flies into the face of unknown terrors, while the Ilse Witch and her dark allies follow, waiting to strike . . .</p><p>Terry Brooks's new Shannara epic, The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara, kicks off its first volume, <i>Ilse Witch</i>, with the discovery of a mad elf drifting on wreckage miles out at sea with his tongue and eyes removed and a map secreted among his possessions. The elf is revealed to be a lost prince who set out decades earlier to find old magics on another continent. Walker Boh, the Druid we last saw in <i>The Talismans of Shannara</i>, persuades the Elf King that both vengeance and prudence dictate a second expedition and assembles the usual crew of talented misfits to travel by airship into unknown territory. The forces of evil are on their way as well--the shadowy figure known as the Ilse Witch and the lizard-like mercenaries forced on her by her untrustworthy ally, the Morgawr, are closing in, with acquisition and murder in their hearts.<p> Fans of Terry Brooks will know precisely what to expect from him: undemanding sword-and-sorcery adventure with touches of the gloomily mysterious and of more complex emotions. This is Brooks at his best and this novel is the least dependent on earlier models as it becomes clear that in this sequence the relationship between good and evil is more complicated than usual. <i>--Roz Kaveney, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara: Ilse Witch is Terry Brooks&#39; first new Shannara novel since The First King of Shannara (1996), and chronologically it takes place a generation after The Talisman of Shannara (1993). It is book one of a planned trilogy, book two will be published in Sep. 2001. A special note on the jacket: it&#39;s done digitally by noted British artist Steve Stone - very cool stuff. Steve Stone also created brand-new art for 4 of Terry Brooks&#39; earlier novels (Sword of Shananra, Elfstone of Shannara, Wishsong of Shannara, and First King of Shannara). I hope you will enjoy this book. - Kuo-Yu Liang, Associate Publisher, Ballantine Books.</p><h2>Discourse on Free Will: Erasmus &amp; Luther</h2><p>&lt;img src="http://www.continuumbooks.com/pub/images/impactslogo.gif" align="left"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Desiderius Eramsus (1466/9-1536) was the most renowned scholar of his age, a celebrated humanist and Classicist, and the first teacher of Greek at Cambridge.

My Name is Lucy Barton. Viking, 2016. 13 cm x 20.5 cm. 193 Pages. Original Hardcover. Excellent condition with only very minor signs of external wear.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of January 2016:</strong> Do not be misled by the slimness of this volume, the quietness of its prose, the seeming simplicity of its story line: Elizabeth Strout&#x2019;s <em> My Name is Lucy Barton</em> is as powerful and disturbing as the best of Strout&#x2019;s work, including the Pulitzer Prizewinning <em> Olive Kitteridge</em>. In fact, it bears much resemblance to that novel-- and to Strout&#x2019;s debut <em> Amy and Isabelle</em>--in that it deals with small-town women, who are always more complicated than they seem and often less likable than many contemporary heroines. Here, Strout tells the story of a thirtysomething wife and mother who is in the hospital for longer than she expected, recovering from an operation. She&#x2019;s not dying, but her situation is serious enough that her mother-- whom she has not seen in many years-- arrives at her bedside. The two begin to talk. Their style is undramatic, gentle-- just the simple unspooling of memories between women not generally given to sharing them; still, the accumulation of detail and the repetitive themes of longing and lifelong missed connections add up to revelations that, in another writer&#x2019;s heavy hands, might be melodramatic. In Strout&#x2019;s they are anything but. Rarely has a book been louder in its silences, or more plainly and completely devastating. <em>--Sara Nelson</em>Elizabeth Strout is the Pulitzer prize-winning author of Olive Kitteridge, as well as The Burgess Boys, a New York Times bestseller, Abide With Me and Amy and Isabelle, which won the Los Angeles Times Art Seidenbaum Award for First Fiction and the Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize.

"Her grasp of Victorian character and conscience still astonishes,&nbsp;&nbsp;said The Cleveland Plain Dealer about the author. Hundreds of thousands of readers agree.Pitt knocked on the assistant commissioner's door and waited. It must be sensitive, and urgent, or Cornwallis would not have sent for him by telephone. Since his promotion to command of the Bow Street station Pitt had not involved himself in cases personally unless they threatened to be embarrassing to someone of importance, or else politically dangerous, such as the murder in Ashworth Hall five months earlier, in October 1890. It had ruined the attempt at some reconciliation of the Irish Problem&#x2014;although with the scandal of the divorce of Katie O'Shea, citing Charles Stewart Parnell, the leader of the Irish majority in Parliament, the whole situation was on the brink of disaster anyway.<br><br>Cornwallis opened the door himself. He was not as tall as Pitt, but lean and supple, moving easily, as if the physical strength and grace he had needed at sea were still part of his nature. So was the briefness of speech, the assumption of obedience and a certain simplicity of thought learned by one long used to the ruthlessness of the elements but unaccustomed to the devious minds of politicians and the duplicity of public manners. He was learning, but he still relied on Pitt. He looked unhappy now, his face, with its long nose and wide mouth, was set in lines of apprehension.<br><br>"Come in, Pitt." He stood aside, holding the door back. "Sorry to require you to come so quickly, but there is a very nasty situation in Brunswick Gardens. At least, there looks to be." He was frowning as he closed the door and walked back to his desk. It was a pleasant room, very different from the way it had been during his predecessor's tenure. Now there were some nautical instruments on the surfaces, a sea chart of the English Channel on the far wall, and among the necessary books on law and police procedure, there were also an anthology of poetry, a novel by Jane Austen, and the Bible.<br><br>Pitt waited until Cornwallis had sat down, then did so himself. His jacket hung awkwardly because his pockets were full. Promotion had not made him conspicuously tidier.<br><br>"Yes sir?" he said enquiringly.<br><br>Cornwallis leaned back, the light shining on his head. His complete baldness became him. It was hard to imagine him differently. He never fidgeted, but when he was most concerned he put his fingers together in a steeple and held them still. He did so now.<br><br>"A young woman has met with a violent death in the home of a most respected clergyman, highly esteemed for his learned publications and very possibly in line for a bishopric: the vicar of St. Michael's, the Reverend Ramsay Parmenter." He took a deep breath, watching Pitt's face. "A doctor who lives a few doors away was sent for, and on seeing the body he telephoned for the police. They came immediately, and in turn telephoned me."<br><br>Pitt did not interrupt.<br><br>"It appears that it may be murder and Parmenter himself may have some involvement in it." Cornwallis did not add anything as to his own feelings, but his fears were clear in the very slight pinching around his mouth and the hurt in his eyes. He regarded leadership, both moral and political, as a duty, a trust which could not be broken without terrible consequences. All his adult life so far had been spent at sea, where the captain's word was absolute. The entire ship survived or sank on his skill and his judgment. He must be right; his orders were obeyed. To fail to do so was mutiny, punishable by death. He himself had learned to obey, and in due time he had risen to occupy that lonely pinnacle. He knew both its burdens and its privileges.<br><br>"I see," Pitt said slowly. "Who was she, this young woman?"<br><br>"Miss Unity Bellwood," Cornwallis replied. "A scholar of ancient languages. She was assisting Reverend Parmenter in research for a book he is writing."<br><br>"What makes the doctor and the local police suspect murder?" Pitt asked.<br><br>Cornwallis winced and his lips pulled very slightly thinner. "Miss Bellwood was heard to cry out 'No, no, Reverend!' immediately before she fell, and the moment afterwards Mrs. Parmenter came out of the withdrawing room and found her lying at the bottom of the stairs. When she went to her she was already dead. Apparently she had broken her neck in the fall."<br><br>"Who heard her cry out?"<br><br>"Several people," Cornwallis answered bleakly. "I am afraid there is no doubt. I wish there were. It is an extremely ugly situation. Some sort of domestic tragedy, I imagine, but because of the Parmenters' position it will become a scandal of considerable proportion if it is not handled very quickly&#x2014;and with tact."<br><br>"Thank you," Pitt said dryly. "And the local police do not wish to keep the case?" It was a rhetorical question, asked without hope. Of course they did not. And in all probability they would not be permitted to, even had they chosen to do so. It promised to be a highly embarrassing matter for everyone concerned.<br><br>Cornwallis did not bother to answer. "Number seventeen, Brunswick Gardens," he said laconically. "I'm sorry, Pitt." He seemed about to add something more, then changed his mind, as if he did not know how to word it.<br><br>Pitt rose to his feet. "What is the name of the local man in charge?"<br><br>"Corbett."<br><br>"Then I shall go and relieve Inspector Corbett of his embarrassment," Pitt said without pleasure. "Good morning, sir."<br><br>Cornwallis smiled at him until he reached the door, then turned back to his papers again.<br><br>Pitt telephoned the Bow Street station and gave orders that Sergeant Tellman was to meet him in Brunswick Gardens, on no account to go in ahead of him, and then took a hansom himself.<br><br>It was nearly half past eleven when he alighted in bright, chill sunshine opposite the open space and bare-leafed trees near the church. It was a short walk to number seventeen, and he saw even at twenty yards' distance an air of difference about it. The curtains were already drawn, and there was a peculiar silence surrounding it, as if no housemaids were busy airing rooms, opening windows or scurrying in and out of the areaway, receiving deliveries.<br><br>Tellman was waiting on the pavement opposite, looking as dour as usual, his lantern-jawed face suspicious, gray eyes narrow.<br><br>"What's happened here then?" he said grimly. "Been robbed of the family silver, have they?"<br><br>Tersely, Pitt told him what he knew, and added a warning as to the extreme tact needed.<br><br>Tellman had a sour view of wealth, privilege and established authority in general if it depended upon birth; and unless it was proved otherwise, he assumed it did. He said nothing, but his expression was eloquent.<br><br>Pitt pulled the bell at the front door and the door was opened immediately by a police constable looking profoundly unhappy. He saw that Pitt's hair was rather too long, his pockets bulging, and his cravat lopsided, and drew in his breath to deny him entrance. He barely noticed Tellman, standing well behind.<br><br>"Superintendent Pitt," Pitt announced himself. "And Sergeant Tellman. Mr. Cornwallis asked us to come. Is Inspector Corbett here?"<br><br>The constable's face flooded with relief. "Yes sir, Mr. Pitt. Come in, sir. Mr. Corbett's in the 'all. This way."<br><br>Pitt waited for Tellman and then closed the door. He and Tellman followed the constable across the outer vestibule into the ornate hall. The floor was a mosaic in a design of black lines and whirls on white, which Pitt thought had a distinctly Italian air. The staircase was steep and black, set against the wall on three sides and built of ebonized wood. One of the walls was tiled in deep marine blue. There was a large potted palm in a black tub directly beneath the newel post at the top. Two round white columns supported a gallery, and the main article of furniture was an exquisite Turkish screen. It was all very modern and at any other time would have been most impressive.<br><br>Now the eye was taken with the group of figures at the bottom of the stairs: a young and unhappy doctor putting his instruments back into his case; a second young man standing stiffly, his body tense, as if he wanted to take some action but did not know what. The third was a man a generation older with thinning hair and a grave and anxious expression. The fourth, and last, figure was more than half covered by a blanket, and all Pitt could see of her was the curve of her shoulders and hips as she lay sprawled on the floor.<br><br>The older man turned as he heard Pitt's step.<br><br>"Mr. Pitt," the constable said to this man, his face eager, as if he were bearing good news. "And Sergeant Tellman. The commissioner sent them, sir."<br><br>Corbett shared his constable's relief and made no pretense about it.<br><br>"Oh! Good morning, sir," he responded. "Dr. Greene here has just finished. Nothing to do for the poor lady, of course. And this is Mr. Mallory Parmenter, the Reverend Parmenter's son."<br><br>"How do you do, Mr. Parmenter," Pitt replied, and nodded to the doctor. He looked around at the hallway, then up the stairs. They were steep and uncarpeted. Anyone pushed from the top and falling all the way likely would be injured severely. It did not surprise him that in this instance such a fall should have proved fatal. He moved closer and bent down to look at the body of the young woman, holding back the blanket. She was on her side, her face half turned away from him. He could see she had been extremely handsome in a willful and sensuous fashion. Her features were strong, brows level and her mouth full-lipped. He could easily believe that she had been intelligent, but he saw little gentleness in her.<br><br>"Died from the fall," Corbett said almost under his breath. "About an hour and a half ago." He pulled a watch out of his waistcoat pocket. "The hall clock struck ten jus...</p><h2>Otto: The Autobiography of a Teddy Bear</h2><p>This is an autobiographical tale of a teddy bear named Otto. Otto is a German-born teddy bear. His first memories are of being stitched together and being given to David, a Jewish boy living in Germany before WWII. David and his best-friend Oskar always play with Otto, using him for pranks, games and even teaching him to type on a typewriter. Life is a lot of fun for the Otto. However, one day, David starts to wear a yellow star on his jacket. He and his parents are soon carted away by men in leather coats and uniforms. David decides to give his dear teddy bear to Oskar. Many lonely days pass for Oskar and Otto. But even gloomier days soon arrive when Osakar&#39;s father is drafted into the army and the bombings start. One day, a sudden explosion sends Otto flying through the air and into the middle a raging battle-field. The teddy bear is spotted by a soldier, but the moment the soldier picks Otto up, they are both shot through the chest. Otto and the soldier, an American G.I., are taken away to a hospital. In hospital, the soldier keeps Otto by his side. When he recovers, he pins a medal on Otto&#39;s chest, saying that Otto saved his life, taking the brunt of the bullet. The story makes papers and Otto becomes a mascot of the soldier&#39;s regiment. The teddy bear is then taken to America and is given to a sweet girl called Jasmin, the soldier&#39;s daughter. But Otto&#39;s new home and happiness is once again brutally ended when he is snatched away by mean and violent street urchins, who hit and trample on him and throw him into a bin. Otto is then picked up by an antiques dealer and taken to his shop. Years and years go by, until one rainy evening, when a bulky man stops and carefully examines the shop window. The man recognizes the bear instantly buys him. It is Oskar, Otto&#39;s old friend. The story of Oskar, a German tourist and survivor of the war finding his teddy bear in America soon makes the papers. And the day after Otto&#39;s picture appears in the paper, Oskar&#39;s telephone rings: it is his old friend David. And so, the three friends finally reunite, sharing the sorrows and pains of war and living a peaceful and happy life together. Otto now keeps himself busy, typing the story of his life on David&#39;s typewriter. Children will become attached to this loving, innocent protagonist, and will naturally be interested in his life story. Tomi Ungerer deals with one of the darkest chapters of history and pulls off the challenge admirably. This tale will prompt reflection and important questions without causing undue fear.</p><p>Tomi Ungerer is one of the world&#39;s most famous and best-loved children&#39;s authors. An illustrator, writer, designer, toy-collector and archivist of human absurdity, his work spans storybooks, poster designs, political campaigns and film. He is a recipient of the Hans Christian Andersen prize for illustration, and the Musee Tomi Ungerer, devoted exclusively to his work, opened in Strasbourg in 2007.Gr 1-4-A teddy bear recounts his creation in Germany before World War II, his arrival as a birthday present for a young Jewish boy, and his time with David and David&#39;s friend, Oskar. When authorities force David to wear a yellow star and transport him and others away, Otto stays behind with Oskar. An African-American G.I. finds the bear after a bomb blast, a bullet hits them both, and because the bear absorbs the brunt of the blast, he saves the soldier&#39;s life. Otto becomes the playmate of the soldier&#39;s daughter until he is mauled by street boys, lands in a garbage pail, and eventually in an antique shop. From there the story takes an even more surprising and satisfying twist as Otto is reunited with his childhood friends. Ungerer&#39;s large watercolors become dark and shadow-filled as the Jews are taken away, people hide in bomb shelters, and bombs explode in the city. In a particularly realistic spread, one soldier lies slumped over a tank in the distance while, in the foreground, readers see a prostrate soldier clutching his bleeding chest, another one trapped under rubble, and a bodiless outstretched arm. While the book touches on some difficult subjects, the story is told from the point of view of the bear, which makes discussion a bit easier for younger children. Otto appears scarred and battle-worn on the cover but is a survivor nonetheless, and his telling is matter-of-fact and unsentimental.

In the early 1970s, he received his grounding in the Scriptures and in the Spirit at Pinecrest Bible Training Center in upstate New York, where he also met and married the love of his life, Marsha.

When we think of French cooking, we might picture a fine restaurant with a small army of chefs hovering over sauces for hours at a stretch, crafting elegant dishes with special utensils, hard-to-find ingredients, and architectural skill. But this kind of cooking bears little relationship to the way that real French families eat-yet they eat very well indeed. Now that the typical French woman (the bonne femme of the title) works outside the home like her American counterpart, the emphasis is on easy techniques, simple food, and speedy preparation, all done without sacrificing taste. In a voice that is at once grounded in the wisdom of classical French cooking, yet playful and lighthearted when it comes to the potential for relaxing and enjoying our everyday lives in the kitchen, Moranville offers 300 recipes that focus on simple, fresh ingredients prepared well. The Bonne Femme Cookbook is full of tips and tricks and shortcuts, lots of local color and insight into real French home kitchens, and above all, loads of really good food. It gives French cooking an accessible, friendly, and casual spin.</p><p><strong>A Note from the Author</strong> <p></p> <p></p> <p> Dear Amazon Readers:</p> <p> Have you ever wondered how today&#x2019;s French women cook? After all, the French cherish (and expect!) the pleasures of a great meal at the end of each day. And yet, most French women don&#x2019;t have hours to spend in the kitchen any more than we do. How, then, do they do it? </p> <p> Well, I&#x2019;ve written a book about it. In <i>The Bonne Femme Cookbook</i>, I approach French cooking not as a chef or leisure cook, but rather in the spirit of today&#x2019;s French woman (the bonne femme of my title), who, like you, enjoys sharing fresh, stylish, and life-enhancing food&#x2014;but would rather spend more time at the table than in the kitchen. </p> <p> The past two decades, I&#x2019;ve worked as a food and wine writer, a job that has allowed me to spend major stretches of my summers in France. I&#x2019;ve set up house in charming apartments from Paris to the Dordogne, from the C�te d&#x2019;Azur near Italy, to the C�te Vermeille near Spain. Everywhere I&#x2019;ve stayed, I&#x2019;ve become immersed in the food of the region. While I&#x2019;ve dined in restaurants and in French homes&#x2014;gleaning cooking tips from the bonnes femmes I&#x2019;ve met&#x2014;what I loved most was cooking like a bonne femme myself. My days in France would see me heading to the markets, chatting with butchers, greengrocers, and cheesemongers, picking up French cooking magazines, and perusing the menus of the town&#x2019;s mom-and-pop bistros for inspiration. </p> <p> Most every evening would find me in my little French kitchen, cooking simple yet gratifying dishes akin to what women all over town were serving to their own friends and families. </p> <p> Day after day, summer after summer, it occurred to me how quick and easy a good, home-cooked French meal could be. Once home and back on the job, I found that so many of the everyday recipes I&#x2019;d enjoyed in France translate beautifully to the American table. </p> <p> My favorites are in this book, and I hope that they will soon become yours. Here&#x2019;s an overview of what you&#x2019;ll find:</p> <p>* Dozens of recipes that showcase a clever take on the saut�/deglaze method of cooking. That is, you saut� the night&#x2019;s meat, you deglaze the pan with wine. Then, simply add a handful of easy-to-find ingredients to make a true-to-France pan sauce, all in 30 minutes or less. </p> <p>* New takes on French stews and braises. Believe me, there&#x2019;s more to the French stewpot than Boeuf Bourguignon and Coq au Vin (though I do include both). Enjoy recipes for hearty, warming (yet up-to-date) stews and braises, such as Pomegranate Pot-au-Feu, Tuna Steaks Braised with Tomatoes, Olives and Fennel and other recipes that call on contemporary ingredients for meals that are dashing, yet uncomplicated in that fix-and-forget way.</p> <p>* More chapters that will help you cook like a French woman. You&#x2019;ll find appetizers, salads, soups, eggs and cheese, and desserts, as well as great recipes for dishes you might not think of as French, (but that definitely fit into the bonne femme&#x2019;s repertoire!). These include sandwiches, burgers, pizzas, pastas, and casseroles. (French Shepherd&#x2019;s Pie, anyone?)</p> <p> I promise that throughout my 250-plus recipes, you&#x2019;ll find no hard-to-find ingredients, no difficult techniques&#x2014;just fresh, simple, and splendid recipes that prove, again and again, that you can cook like a French woman no matter where you live.</p> <p></p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p></p> <i>--Wini Moranville</i> <p></p> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with Author Wini Moranville</strong> <br> <br> <p><strong>Q:How did the idea for <i>The Bonne Femme Cookbook</i> come about? </strong> </p><p><strong> A:</strong> For the past 20 years, I&#x2019;ve spent major stretches of my summers in France, where my husband and I would rent an apartment so we could live, eat, and cook like a French person. In doing so, I&#x2019;ve discovered a fresh, everyday-easy side of French cooking that translated quite beautifully to the American table.</p> <p>And yet, as a contributing writer and editor for numerous cookbooks and food magazines, I noticed that mainstream food editors often shy away from French food as a topic for everyday cooking. Often, French cuisine is perceived as difficult, pricey, and complex.</p> <p>But French <i>home</i> cooking is none of these things: Most French women have no more time or resources to spend on their cooking than we do. And yet they eat splendidly, night after night. I decided to write a book about how they manage to do so.</p> <p><strong>Q: What is the <i>bonne femme</i> style of cooking?<br></strong> </p><p><strong>A:</strong> In French, <i>bonne femme</i> means, "the good wife," but in French cooking, it refers to simple, uncomplicated food served in homes, no matter who does the cooking&#x2014;husband, wife, friend, or partner. </p> <p>While <i>cuisine de bonne femme</i> is traditionally hearty and rustic, I&#x2019;ve provided many recipes that are also light, fresh, stylish and modern&#x2014;in line with the way contemporary French women cook today. I like to think of my overall approach as "<i>bonne femme moderne</i>." </p><p><strong>Q: Why do you think French cooking intimidates so many American home cooks? Is it really as complex and laborious as we think? </strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> One reason, I believe, is that most of our first encounters with French food was through French restaurants. Until the last decade or so, most U.S. French restaurants came complete with tuxedoed waiters, crystal chandeliers, desserts flamb�ed tableside&#x2014;buzzes and whistles that said, "don&#x2019;t try this at home."</p> <p> In recent years, casual corner bistros have helped change that perception, of course, but for many, French food still feels outside of the realm of what we cook everyday. </p> <p><strong>Q:Is it really do-able to cook and eat like the French, without spending a lot of time in the kitchen or money on obscure ingredients? </strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! Remember&#x2014;French women often work outside the home, too, so they need quick, stylish recipes, but they also expect to eat well. That&#x2019;s what this book is about. </p> <p>The Saut�, Deglaze, and Serve chapter shows how you can get a French meal on the table in less than 30 minutes. You simply saut� the night&#x2019;s meat, then deglaze the pan with wine or broth and add a few easy-to- find ingredients&#x2014;grapes or celery root here, sweet potatoes or apples there&#x2014;for a vivid, true-to-France pan sauce. Voil�: Tuesday night French cooking at its fresh-and-simple best. </p> <p>When you have a little more time, the Braise, Stew, or Roast chapter offers classic and contemporary on dishes that may take a little more time on the stove or in the oven, but none are difficult.</p> <p>And I never call on ingredients that are difficult to find. French women don&#x2019;t chase down expensive ingredients on the Internet, so why should we? If I had an inkling that an ingredient might not be available in all markets, I offered a substitution option.</p> <p><strong>Q:Is there really such a thing as easy, everyday French cooking?</strong></p> <p><strong> A:</strong> Absolutely. I&#x2019;ve spent a lot of time dining with and talking to French women and researching French cookbooks and food magazines, and I&#x2019;m convinced that their everyday food really isn&#x2019;t any more time-consuming or difficult, nor does it take special techniques or special equipment. In fact, if you cook at all, you probably have the skills and tools you need to cook most of the recipes in my book. </p> <p><strong>Q: Tell us about The Art of the Ap�ritif.</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> All over France tonight, friends are gathering in homes for a quick drink and a simple (but stylish) bite or two. It&#x2019;s a great way to ease out of the busy workday with some refreshment and conversation, without having to cook an entire diner or commit to providing an evening&#x2019;s worth of entertainment.</p> <p>Afterwards, everyone may go their separate ways for dinner; or, if everyone&#x2019;s having too much fun to move on, the host might invite everyone to stay for a casual meal that she puts together quite effortlessly.</p> <p>I wish we&#x2019;d do more of this free-form style of entertaining, and I offer an entire chapter of French cocktails and simple nibbles for doing so.</p> <p></p>Wini Moranville grew up in Des Moines, Iowa, and attended the University of Iowa, graduating with a B.A. in French and English.

The uncensored exploits of Michael Irvin, Deion Sanders, Emmitt Smith, Troy Aikman, and the rest of the &#x2019;Boys on and off the football field, <i>Boys Will Be Boys</i> makes for riveting, shocking, often wildly hilarious reading.</p></p><p><blockquote><p>They were America's Team&#x2014;the high-priced, high-glamour, high-flying Dallas Cowboys of the 1990s, who won three Super Bowls and made as many headlines off the field as on it. Led by Emmitt Smith, the charismatic Deion "Prime Time" Sanders, and Hall of Famers Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin, the Cowboys rank among the greatest of all NFL dynasties.</p></blockquote><p>In similar fashion to his <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Bad Guys Won!</em>, about the 1986 New York Mets, in <em>Boys Will Be Boys</em>, award-winning writer Jeff Pearlman chronicles the outrageous antics and dazzling talent of a team fueled by ego, sex, drugs&#x2014;and unrivaled greatness. Rising from the ashes of a 1&#x2013;15 season in 1989 to capture three Super Bowl trophies in four years, the Dallas Cowboys were guided by a swashbuckling, skirt-chasing, power-hungry owner, Jerry Jones, and his two eccentric, hard-living coaches, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer. Together the three built a juggernaut that America loved and loathed.</p><p>But for a team that was so dominant on Sundays, the Cowboys were often a dysfunctional circus the rest of the week. Irvin, nicknamed "The Playmaker," battled dual addictions to drugs and women. Charles Haley, the defensive colossus, presided over the team's infamous "White House," where the parties lasted late into the night and a steady stream of long-legged groupies came and went. And then there were Smith and Sanders, whose Texas-sized egos were eclipsed only by their record-breaking on-field perfomances.</p><p>With an unforgettable cast of characters and a narrative as hard-hitting and fast-paced as the team itself, <em>Boys Will Be Boys</em> immortalizes the most beloved&#x2014;and despised&#x2014;dynasty in NFL history.</p><p>Jeff Pearlman is a columnist for SI.com, a former Sports Illustrated senior writer, and the critically acclaimed author of <em>Boys Will Be Boys</em>, <em>The Bad Guys Won!</em>, and <em>Love Me, Hate Me</em>. </p></p><h2>Principles of Personal Defense</h2><p>This revised edition of Jeff Cooper&#39;s classic on personal defense is the best study of the guiding principles of survival in the face of unprovoked violence by human assailants.

No matter how many times you read it, you will always find one more pearl of wisdom that you missed during the last read.&#34; --Louis Awerbuck</p><h2>Acts</h2><p>Larry Woiwode has been called "a prodigiously gifted stylist" (The New Republic) who can "wring your heart" (The Boston Globe) with his talent for evoking in language "pure, cleanly wrought beauty until it is made to seem both universal and extraordinary" (The Atlantic Monthly). Here Woiwode turns to the book of Acts, the generational history of the early Christians, and finds it a suitable framework within which to share his thoughts on storywriting, Christianity, the deleterious impact of culture upon the contemporary church, and the church's inability to clearly define itself or respond effectively to cultural attacks.<br>Woiwode takes us through the narrative journey of the book of Acts, analyzing each event with a writer's sensibility. He establishes a clear-eyed view of the true basis and purpose of Christianity, and points out how today's Church seems to be drifting farther and farther from those origins. Fresh and compelling, filled with revelations of Woiwode's own spiritual journey, Acts will absorb and enlighten anyone who has savored this master writer's fictional work.</p><p>Courageous but flawed attempt by Woiwode (Indian Affairs, 1992, etc.) to examine Christian culture and his own faith in the light of Acts, ``the most overtly narrative book of the New Testament.'' Woiwode's grit lies in his willingness to discuss Christianity despite--as he hammers home--the bias against religion among America's cultural and academic elite. He ponders the task of the Christian writer and finds it, as did Dante, Tolstoy, and Eliot before him, to be a search for ``a way to live the life Christ calls us to live.'' The best compass here, says Woiwode, remains the Bible. Thus his interest in Acts, toward which he takes a Protestant approach (Woiwode is an rthodox Presbyterian), paring away doctrines that he sees as excrescences to get at the unvarnished revelation. His technique, a combination of common sense and writerly savvy that ignores biblical scholarship, gets him into trouble at times. For instance, while it's charming and even instructive to call Peter's account of Judas's suicide ``an elaboration, in a sophisticated accreting manner that would please a Robbe-Grillet,'' it's naive to believe that the numbers in Acts (e.g., 40 days as the span of Jesus' post-Resurrection appearances) must be literally true because, as Woiwode claims, Luke has a novelist's eye for factual detail: Such literalism ignores the different aims and methods of modern and ancient writers. Similar exegetic goofs pepper the text, but no matter; far more exciting is Woiwode's ability to connect the ancient dramas of Acts to modern life. In so doing, he plucks away at the nature of sin, baptism, miracle, and other issues, and tells of his own religious conversion and return to the land, always in the same shimmering prose that marks his fiction (``I pressed a footpedal that released a pyramid of fifteen finished bales, outlined white-gold in a sudden gate of sun''). Pretty shaky as scholarship--but a tough, moving personal testament. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Teacher and fiction writer Woiwode ( Born Brothers , LJ 8/88) journeys between his own intense faith experiences and that of the earliest Christian communities in ten essays on the New Testament book attributed to Luke. He asserts the faith of historical Christianity over humanist values in a secular culture. At times, this work reads like a seminary lecture on scripture, at others like a modern sermon, and still others like the poetry of a spiritual conversation. The tone is personal, with images from the Bible expressed in modern terms. The author says, "I have tried to address the needs of the student I once was." He describes his journey from youthful Catholicism to hedonism, earnest searching of the scriptures for truth, and, finally, his current espousal of Calvinist-inspired faith. Readers will find this book most valuable for its contemporary reflections; for detailed interpretations of the Book of Acts, they should turn to the many scholarly commentaries available.

Structured as a series of questions, the song/poem explores the sensations, emotions, and spiritual experiences connected with the season: a hawk circling in the sky; the Three Sisters (corn, beans, and squash) sending out their green shoots; the first wild strawberries. The arrangement of the text?one question per double spread?emphasizes the contemplative quality of the verse. Each one evokes an image and invites reflection. An author's note explains the significance of the various symbols depicted. Canyon's lush, vibrant, double-page paintings spill out of their frames and are rich in detail, revealing dewdrops on a snail's shell; imperfections in a green leaf; and scattered spider webs that herald the final depiction of a complete web. The simple, graceful, italic typeface serves to unite text and illustrations. While the pictures are large and clear enough to be seen by a group, the calm exuberance of the poem lends itself best to one-on-one sharing. The book is an especially appropriate supplement for school units on Natvie American culture.?Donna Scanlon, Lancaster County Library, PA<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Debut author Orie, who grew up on an Oneida reservation, describes this book as a song, "a celebration of the circle of life-the return of morning to night as well as of each cycle of the seasons." Pitched in a soothing cadence, her narrative poses a series of questions, asking readers if they have heard, seen or experienced various phenomena that signal the approach of spring. Though her brief introductory note explains the meaning of certain Oneida symbols, many of her questions may seem obscure ("Does your memory bring Sweet Grass's fragrance?"; "Did you see the fields of the Three Sisters coming?"; "Did you see Trillium's Stars lying upon the Forest bed's heaven?"). More appropriately geared to the target audience are Canyon's (The Ever-Living Tree) dramatic, large-scale paintings, in which animals, insects, birds and flowers and are rendered in impressive detail.

In this powerful and beautiful story, we follow a group of people in a small town during this dramatic and harrowing time, the era that was a forebear of the Tiananmen Square uprising.<br><br>Morning dawns on the provincial city of Muddy River. A young woman, Gu Shan, a bold spirit and a follower of Chairman Mao, has renounced her faith in Communism. Now a political prisoner, she is to be executed for her dissent. Her distraught mother, determined to follow the custom of burning her only child&#x2019;s clothing to ease her journey into the next world, is about to make another bold decision. Shan&#x2019;s father, Teacher Gu, who has already, in his heart and mind, buried his rebellious daughter, begins to retreat into memories. Neither of them imagines that their daughter&#x2019;s death will have profound and far-reaching effects, in Muddy River and beyond.<br><br>In luminous prose, Yiyun Li weaves together the lives of these and other unforgettable characters, including a serious seven-year-old boy, Tong; a <br>crippled girl named Nini; the sinister idler Bashi; and Kai, a beautiful radio news announcer who is married to a man from a powerful family. Life in a world of oppression and pain is portrayed through stories of resilience, sacrifice, perversion, courage, and belief. We read of delicate moments and acts of violence by mothers, sons, husbands, neighbors, wives, lovers, and more, as Gu Shan&#x2019;s execution spurs a brutal government reaction.<br><br>Writing with profound emotion, and in the superb tradition of fiction by such writers as Orhan Pamuk and J. M. Coetzee, Yiyun Li gives us a stunning novel that is at once a picture of life in a special part of the world during a historic period, a universal portrait of human frailty and courage, and a mesmerizing work of art.</p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, February 2009</b>"&gt;Amazon Best of the Month, February 2009:&nbsp; During the Cultural Revolution countless unspeakable acts went down in the otherwise unremarkable industrial town of Muddy River. Lovers betrayed lovers, children denounced their parents, and neighbors became sworn enemies. A few years later, the townspeople have convened at the public stadium to witness the execution of Gu Shan. A Red Guard leader in her youth, she has received the death penalty for her counterrevolutionary writings and unrepentant attitude. In Yiyun Li's startling debut novel, <em>The Vagrants</em>, we are introduced to Gu's parents, neighbors, and a handful of Muddy River's social outcasts whose lives have been irrevocably affected by her life and death. Yiyun Li's unblinking and unpredictable fictional narrative demonstrates how corruption and cruelty, fear, and moral ambiguity at the level of the individual reflect the dehumanization of an entire society. <em>The Vagrants</em> establishes Li as an important new voice in American fiction. <em>--Lauren Nemroff</em>Yiyun Li is a winner of the Frank O&#x2019;Connor International Short Story Award, the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award, and the Guardian First Book Award.

Set in Cypress Hills in southern Saskatchewan, where Stegner's family homesteaded from 1914 to 1920, <b>Wolf Willow </b>brings to life both the pioneer community and the magnificent landscape that surrounds it. This Twentieth-Century Classics edition includes a new introductory essay by Page Stegner.</p><p><b>Wallace Stegner</b> was born in 1909 in Lake Mills, Iowa. The son of Scandinavian immigrants, he traveled with his parents and brother all over the West-to North Dakota, Washington, Saskatchewan, Montana, and Wyoming-before settling in Salt Lake City in 1921. Many of the landscapes he encountered in his peripatetic youth figure largely in his work, as do characters based on his stern father and athletic, outgoing brother. Stegner received most of his education in Utah, graduating from the University in 1930. He furthered his education at the University of Iowa, where he received a master's and a doctoral degree. He married Mary Stuart Page in 1934, and for the next decade the couple followed Wallace's teaching career-to the University of Wisconsin, Harvard, and eventually to Stanford University, where he founded the creative writing program, and where he was to remain until his retirement in 1971. A number of his creative writing students have become some of today's most well respected writers, including Wendell Berry, Thomas McGuane, Raymond Carver, Edward Abbey, Robert Stone, and Larry McMurty.<p>Throughout his career and after, Stegner's literary output was tremendous. His first novel, Remembering Laughter, was published in 1937. By the time of his death in 1993 he had published some two dozen works of fiction, history, biography, and essays. Among his many literary prizes are the Pulitzer Prize for <b>Angle of Repose</b> (1971) and the National Book Award for <b>The Spectator Bird </b>(1976). His collection of essays, <b>Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs</b> (1992), was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle award.</p><p>Although his fiction deals with many universal themes, Stegner is primarily recognized as a writer of the American West. Much of his literature deals with debunking myths of the West as a romantic country of heroes on horseback, and his passion for the terrain and its inhabitants have earned him the title 'The Dean of Western Letters'. He was one of the few true Men of Letters in this generation. An historian, essayist, short story writer and novelist, as well as a leading environmental writer. Although always connected in people's minds with the West, he had a long association with New England. Many short stories and one of his most successful novels, Crossing to Safety, are set in Vermont, where he had a summer home for many years. Another novel, <b>The Spectator Bird</b>, takes place in Denmark.</p><p>An early environmentalist, he actively championed the region's preservation and was instrumental-with his now-famous 'Wilderness Letter'-in the passage of the 1964 Wilderness Act. Honest and straightforward, educated yet unpretentious, cantankerous yet compassionate, <b>Wallace Stegner</b> was an enormous presence in the American literary landscape, a man who wrote and lived with ferocity, energy, and integrity.</p><p><b>Page Stegner</b> is a Professor Emeritus of American Literature at the University of California at Santa Cruz.</p>Beautiful and moving...In many ways the best of all the good books Stegner has written. -- <i>Walter Van Tilberg Clarck</i><br><br>Enchanting, heartrending, and eminently enviable. -- <i>Vladimir Nabokov</i></p><h2>The Good Brother</h2><p>Virgil, the good brother, must avenge the death of his hell-raising brother Boyd to fulfill the unwritten code of his Kentucky community, but he decides to escape to Montana, where he finds peace until his past catches up to him</p><p>Chris Offutt is the author of <i>Kentucky Straight</i> and <i>The Same River Twice.</i> The recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Whiting Award, and an award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, he was named one of <i>Granta</i>'s Best Young American Fiction Writers. He lives in Missoula, Montana, with his wife and two sons.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>Virgil followed the rain branch off the hill and drove to the Blizzard post office. The mail hadn't come yet and he continued past, giving a general wave to the crowd that gossiped in the glare of April sun. He drove up a steep hill to the county line. It was only two miles from the house he'd grown up in, but he'd never crossed it.<br><br>He parked by the edge of the cliff. The color of the air was brighter at the top. Clay Creek ran through the hollow with purple milkweed blooming in the ditch. When Virgil was a kid, he and his brother had walked its slippery bank, gathering enough empty pop bottles to buy candy when they reached Blizzard's only store. Virgil wished he and Boyd could do it again but people had stopped throwing pop bottles away when the deposit rose to a nickel. The store closed when the owner died. Boyd was dead now, too.<br><br>Virgil tried to imagine the land when it was flat across the hilltops, before a million years of rain chewed the dirt to make creeks and hollows. Clouds lay in heaps like sawdust piles. He figured he was seeing out of the county and he wondered if hawks could see farther, or just better. The world seemed smaller from above. The dips and folds of the wooded hills reminded him of a rumpled quilt that needed smoothing out.<br><br>Cars were leaving the post office, which meant the mail truck had arrived. A titmouse clung to a tree upside down, darting its head to pick an insect from a leaf. Pine sap ran like blood from a wound in the tree. Virgil drove down the road and parked in willow shade beside the creek. A tattered flag dangled above the post office, fastened permanently to a hickory pole. Every morning the postmaster, a white-haired man named Zephaniah, dragged the flagpole from the post office and slipped one end into a hole in the earth beside a fence post. He buckled a leather belt around the flagpole and the post. At day's end he stored the pole inside.<br><br>Instead of a system of organized boxes, Zephaniah had laid out a few narrow tables to correspond roughly with the surrounding terrain -- two hollows, a hill, and a creek. He arranged the day's mail in stacks that represented the location of each family's house in the community. Virgil leaned on the narrow shelf that protruded from the arched hole in the wall where Zephaniah worked. The shelf's edge was round and smooth from years of use.<br><br>"Flag's looking kindly ragged, ain't it," Virgil said.<br><br>"Government never sent a new one this year."<br><br>"Can't you tell them?"<br><br>"Could."<br><br>The screen door banged as a man from Red Bird Ridge came in.<br><br>"Mail run yet?" he said to Virgil.<br><br>"Just did."<br><br>"I ain't seen you since..."<br><br>The man adjusted his cap, looked at the floor, and rapidly scratched his sideburn. The last time they'd met had been at Boyd's funeral. Virgil didn't know how to ease the man's discomfort.<br><br>"Well, a long while went by since I seen you," the man said.<br><br>He stepped to the window and looked through the mail that Zephaniah had gathered for him.<br><br>"Write me a order, will you, Zeph?"<br><br>"How much?"<br><br>"Ten dollars even. Mamaw owes the doctors that much a month."<br><br>"Which doctor?"<br><br>"I don't know, that clinic in town. The one everybody goes to."<br><br>"Rocksalt Medical?"<br><br>"Reckon."<br><br>Zephaniah filled out the form, printing carefully. When he finished, he waited, and Virgil knew that Zephaniah would stand there all day rather than insult the man by asking him to write his name on the money order.<br><br>"Go ahead and sign it for me, Zeph."<br><br>Zephaniah wrote the man's name at the bottom of the money order, and asked for eleven dollars. The man placed three fives on the shelf.<br><br>"Buying money sure ain't cheap," he said.<br><br>"Best to have a checking account," Zephaniah said.<br><br>"None of my people have fooled with banks and I ain't about to start now."<br><br>"Need an envelope?"<br><br>The man nodded. Zephaniah wrote the address on a pre-stamped envelope and made change. The man went outside and spoke to Virgil through the screen. "Come here a minute."<br><br>Virgil went to the door. The man pressed his forehead to the screen, his skin pushing through the mesh in tiny squares. "I knowed your brother," he said. "You tell your mama I'm sorry."<br><br>Virgil never knew what to say back. The man looked up and down the creek before speaking in a ragged whisper. "It was a Rodale done it. Billy Rodale."<br><br>The man walked swiftly to his truck.<br><br>Virgil leaned against the wall and inhaled as deeply as possible. He let the air out in a long slow breath. Across the road, green tendrils of forsythia bushes dragged the creek.<br><br>"Virge?" said Zephaniah. "You all right?"<br><br>"Yeah. Just sick of it."<br><br>"Of what?"<br><br>"You know. Boyd and all."<br><br>"People feel bad."<br><br>"You didn't hear what he said."<br><br>"I heard. Ears is the last thing I got left that works."<br><br>"Well, I'm sick to death of it. I know who it was. The whole damn creek does, and I don't need everybody telling me. They figure I don't know since I ain't done nothing."<br><br>"A man like him ain't worth worrying about. He's the reason for the flag problem."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"I ain't asked for a new flag because I don't want to draw attention. When I retire, this post office will shut down. Only reason it's open now is folks buying money orders. Half this creek pays their bills through me. We're showing a profit here, which ain't exactly something the government is used to."<br><br>"So why close down?"<br><br>"Because profit ain't what they go by."<br><br>"What is?"<br><br>"If I knew that, I'd be President."<br><br>Fifty years ago the post office building had housed the company store for the town of Blizzard. The community had run on scrip issued by the mineral company. Now the mines were empty and the town was gone, along with its barbershop, saloon, train station, and doctor. Most of the families were gone, too. The remaining people still walked off the hillsides for money orders, another form of scrip.<br><br>"If they shut this down," Virgil said, "there won't be much left of here."<br><br>"Church and grade school," Zephaniah said. "I've throwed hours of thought at it. Blizzard's old and wore out, and the government's getting rid of it. They ain't too many to care about us. I'd say even God was right mad the day he laid this place out. It's as slanty a land as ever was."<br><br>"Maybe you could get a petition."<br><br>"Who'd sign it, Virge? You can't turn in a petition full of X's. They'd say if these people can't read or write, what do they need a post office for? No, Virge. Blizzard's done."<br><br>Zephaniah stood with his shoulders slumped, his arms hanging straight as if held by weights. He suddenly seemed what he was -- short and old.<br><br>"I could retire now," he said. "I'm tired enough, but I'm the last man with a job. That's why I keep working. If I stop, the town stops."<br><br>"Well."<br><br>"It burnt my daddy up that I never left out of here. He died still mad over it. I know they's some saying you ort to take care of that Rodale boy for killing Boyd. More say it than don't, my opinion. But I say get yourself out of here, and I don't mean Rocksalt, either. There's Mount Sterling to think on, even Lexington. No sense going to the state pen over your brother."<br><br>Virgil couldn't imagine leaving Blizzard. He'd lived here thirty-two years. Boyd was the restless one, the wild brother, the one who'd leave one day. Virgil had grown up letting Boyd do the talking and later the running around acting crazy. He drove fast, drank hard, played cards, and chased women. Finally, Boyd had done the dying.<br><br>The narrow hall seemed to squeeze Virgil and he felt a need for breath that he couldn't quite get. He was thirsty. He stumbled outside and smelled honeysuckle vine along the creek. He drove down the road and up the steep dirt lane of his home hill. In his mother's house, he turned on the faucet and let it run to bring water from deep in the earth. He drank two cups fast. His body recognized the water, its cold taste the most familiar sensation he'd ever known. He breathed through his nose as he drank, his chin and shirt wet.<br><br>He was drinking his fourth cup when he noticed his mother and sister watching from the doorway. He set the cup in the sink.<br><br>"Mom," he said, "I ain't going to that post office no more."<br><br>His mother's face didn't change, but the expression of her eyes did. Virgil recognized it as the look she got when Boyd said something outrageous, but she had never regarded Virgil in this manner. He leaned on the sink and looked through the window. It was cracked from the beak of a cardinal that had repeatedly attacked its own reflection.<br><br>"Where's the mail at anyway?" his sister said.<br><br>"I left it."<br><br>"Well, shoot, Virgie." Sara turned to their mother. "I'll send Marlon directly. I'm glad I married somebody who's got some sense, even if it's just to pick up the mail."<br><br>"I just don't like hearing that old gossip down there's all. You go, Sara. You'd talk a bird out of its nest."<br><br>"What were they saying?" Sara said.<br><br>Beside her, their mother waited without speaking. She had spent most of her life in just such a stance -- silent in the kitchen, waiting for news that was invariably bad.<br><br>"You don't really want to know, do you?" Virgil said.<br><br>Sara nodded.<br><br>"They say that Wayne girl is pregnant," he said.<br><br>"No!"<br><br>"Sure is."<br><br>"Which one?"<br><br>"Up on Redbird Ridge."<br>ard<br><br>"I know that," Sara said. "They ain't but one bunch of Waynes. I mean which girl?"<br><br>"The littlest."<br><br>"Lord love a duck, she ain't but fourteen."<br><br>"Well," Virgil said.<br><br>"Whose is it? Anybody say?"<br><br>"They's no question of that."<br><br>"Well, who?"<br><br>"I hate to be the one to tell you, Sara. But it was your Marlon done it."<br><br>Sara's face changed color. Her breath rasped into the air. Their mother glanced at her as if to make sure Sara wasn't going to collapse, then studied Virgil carefully.<br><br>"Sara, honey," she said. "I believe he's telling a story."<br><br>Sara grabbed a sponge and threw it, bouncing it off his chest and leaving a wet mark on his shirt.<br><br>"If you went for the mail," Virgil said, "you'd know true gossip from wrong."<br><br>"If you can't fetch mail," Sara said, "you at least can mow the yard."<br><br>Boyd had taken care of the yard and retrieved the mail. Four months after his death, the family was still trying to divvy up chores.<br><br>Copyright � 1997 by Chris Offutt</p><h2>The Journey of Wishes (The Spirit Flyer, Book 8)</h2><p>When Grandfather Kramar was a boy, he couldn&#x2019;t stand his cousins.

From "yes, the chicken-flavored treats are my favorite," to "no, I'm not quite ready for my bath," all dog devotees are guilty as charged--although not all do it in such a hilarious and endearing manner as writer Roy Blount Jr. and photographer Valerie Shaff in <i>If Only You Knew How Much I Smell You: True Portraits of Dogs</i>. Blount, humorist and author of <i>Be Sweet</i>, brings us closer to "understanding the 'inner dog'" through his use of Doggerel, a uniquely Blount brand of verse with the "canine measure somewhere between ordered and free." The effect of this puppy poetry--when paired with Shaff's truly remarkable duotone photographs of mixed and pure breeds--is comic genius. A Boxer coyly stares into the camera wondering, "What does that mean, 'expensive shoe'? / I ate it because it smelled like you," while a chubby-tummied bulldog declares "Good stick. / Got a good stick. / A real / good / Stick. / Getting all the good / Out of this good / Stick / That's in / This / good / Stick." You'll never be able to resist this entertaining and affectionate look at our canine friends as "they ponder the confusions, certainties, pangs, and pleasures of a dog's life."Valerie Shaff's photographs have appeared in the New Yorker, Paper, Good Housekeeping and Martha Stewart's Living.

In his first new novel since <i>An Instance of the Fingerpost</i> became an international bestseller, Iain Pears transports us to Rome, where an impudent thief has stolen a politically sensitive painting on loan from a foreign museum. Summoned to see the prime minister, Flavia di Stefano, acting head of Italy's Art Theft Squad, is told to retrieve the painting without publicity or payment of ransom. But does the prime minister mean what he says? And why was this particular painting stolen? Faced with a case sure to cause her grief, Flavia turns to her mentor, General Taddeo Bottando, who has a wholly unexpected view of the situation. Flavia's husband of four weeks, art historian Jonathan Argyll, is busy, meanwhile, with a mission of his own. As a gift to the soon-to-retire Bottando, Jonathan will track down the provenance of a small Renaissance painting, an Immaculate Conception, now hanging on Bottando's wall. Who owned the painting over the years, and how did it come into Bottando's hands? Flavia's search for an art thief soon becomes a hunt for a killer, while Jonathan's probe uncovers some startling secrets and an unlikely alliance as poignant as it is surprising. Absorbing, witty, ingeniously plotted, <i>The Immaculate Deception</i> is stylish entertainment from a justly celebrated author.</p><p><b>Iain Pears,</b> bestselling author of <i>An Instance of the Fingerpost,</i> is an art historian with a doctorate in art history from Oxford. He wrote his first Jonathan Argyll crime novel, <i>The Raphael Affair,</i> while his wife was teaching at Smith College in the late 1980s. His other books in the Argyll series are <i>The Titian Committee, The Bernini Bust, The Last Judgement, Giotto's Hand,</i> and <i>Death and Restoration.</i> He is also the author of <i>The Discovery of Painting,</i> published by Yale University Press. He lives in Oxford, England.<p><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> One morning, a fine May morning in Rome, when the sun was beaming through the clouds of carbon monoxide and dust and giving a soft, fresh feel to the day, Flavia di Stefano sat immobile in a vast traffic jam that began in the Piazza del Popolo and ended somewhere near the Piazza Venezia. Many people, at least those with a different personality from her own, would have been unperturbed by this common occurrence, and would instead have contemplated their surroundings with something approaching patient smugness. Not many, after all, can call on a Mercedes, complete with chauffeur and obligatory tinted windows, to ferry them around town at the taxpayers' expense. Fewer still at such a young age are the head (if only the <i>acting</i> head) of one of the more reputable departments in the Italian police force, complete with its own budget, personnel, and expense accounts. </p><p> And virtually none of the small number of departmental potentates use their splendid forms of transport to go to unspecified meetings, called late the previous evening, at the Palazzo Chigi, the official residence of the Italian prime minister. </p><p> That, of course, was the problem, and the reason behind Flavia's insensitivity to the early morning sunshine, and her disdain for all living things. For a start, her collar itched monstrously, and was a permanent, nagging reminder of her own inexperience and desire to create the right impression. Instead of sitting quietly that morning eating toast and drinking coffee, she had run around showering, choosing clothes, and worst of all, applying copious amounts of makeup. Then having a fit of defiance and taking it all off again, then weakening with nerves and putting it all back on. Worse still, she stood peering out of the window into the little piazza below, anxiously waiting for the car to arrive, checking and rechecking the contents of her handbag. She had nightmare visions of grabbing her coat and running through the streets of Rome to get there. Breaking a heel on a cobblestone. Arriving out of breath, her hair in a mess. Creating entirely the wrong impression. Career destroyed, over in a moment, just because some damn fool driver didn't turn up. And what was more, she felt ill; stomach in a turmoil, the rest of her queasy. Bug. Flu, probably. Nervousness. Something like that. It was going to be one of those days. She knew it. </p><p> "Flavia. Do stop jiggling about like that. You're making me nervous." Jonathan Argyll, her husband of four weeks' standing, and boyfriend-cum-flatmate of near ten years, sat at the kitchen table trying to read the newspaper. "It's only the prime minister, you know." </p><p> Flavia turned around to scowl at him. </p><p> "I'm not being facetious," he went on calmly as he reached for the marmalade before she could tell him what she thought of his sense of whimsy. "You know as well as I do that bad news is always handed out by underlings. Besides, you haven't done anything wrong recently, have you? Not misplaced a Raphael, dropped a Michelangelo, shot a senator, or anything?" </p><p> Another scowl. </p><p> "There you are, then. Nothing to worry about," he continued, getting up to give her a quick pat to indicate that he sympathized. "Even less now that your car has arrived." </p><p> He pointed downward, waved cheerfully at the driver, whom he vaguely recognized, and even more cheerfully at Flavia, as she rushed for her bag and coat. </p><p> "Calm. Remember?" he said as she opened the door. </p><p> "I remember." </p><p> Calm, she repeated to herself thirty minutes later as she looked at her watch one more time. Stuck in a traffic jam, half a mile to go, five minutes late. At least it cut the unaccustomed car sickness. Calm, she thought. </p><p> It was Bottando's fault, really, she reflected. Her erstwhile boss, now gone on to greater things, was one of those who liked formulating universal laws about life, which he delivered as aphorisms that came back to haunt you at inappropriate moments. </p><p> "Politicians," he said once over a glass of brandy following a long lunch. "Politicians can ruin your day. Ministers, on the other hand, can ruin your week." </p><p> "And prime ministers?" Flavia had asked. </p><p> "Prime ministers? Oh, they can ruin your life." </p><p> His little bon mot, for some reason, didn't seem quite so urbane at the moment. She considered leaning forward to see if the driver could go any faster, but abandoned the idea. Another one of Bottando's rules. Never let anyone see you are nervous -- especially not drivers, who are notoriously the biggest gossips on the planet. So, like a condemned man who finally realizes his fate is inevitable, she gave a big sigh, leaned back, and gave up fretting. Immediately, the lights changed, the cars began moving, and the palazzo came into sight. She was waved through the vast wooden gates into the courtyard with virtually no delay, and within minutes was being ushered into an anteroom to an anteroom to the office where Antonio Sabauda, prime minister now for a whole nine months, held his audiences. Fourteen minutes late. </p><p> Her guardian angel was on duty, working hard on her behalf. Sabauda was later still, and over the next forty minutes she allowed herself to work up a fine head of steam about the lack of consideration shown by unpunctual people. In fact, by the time the door was finally opened and she was shown in, the nervousness was gone, the deference dissipated, the stomach quiescent, and her character quite restored to its normal state. </p><p> So she marched into the surprisingly dingy office thinking only how stupid she had been to put on quite so much lipstick and wishing she hadn't bothered, shook hands with the prime minister in a uninterested fashion, and sat down on a chair before she was asked. What did she care? She hadn't voted for him. </p><p> He scored early points by referring neither to her age, nor to the fact that she was a woman, and pushed his rating even higher by not indulging in any small talk. Then he spoiled it all by expressing surprise that Bottando himself had not come. Flavia reminded him that she, not General Bottando, was now running the art theft squad on a day-to-day basis. </p><p> "But he is still the head of it, is he not?" </p><p> "Nominally. But he takes no active role in our operations anymore. He is running this European venture, and that uses up all his time." </p><p> "And more of his patience," the prime minister added for her with a faint smile. "I see. And I am sure we are in safe hands with you, signora. I do hope so anyway. I'm afraid there is something of a crisis on hand. I would tell you about it myself, but I know few of the details. Dottore Macchioli knows those, and he has just arrived. This, I'm afraid, is why you have been kept waiting for so long." </p><p> Of course, Flavia thought. All is now clear. Alessandro Macchioli was one of those endearingly lovable characters who sows disaster everywhere he goes. Never on time for anything, however much he tried, always colliding with all manner of inanimate objects that leapt out at him as he passed, he was the very model of the unworldly scholar. And as a scholar he was very fine indeed, so Jonathan told her, as he knew more about this sort of thing than she did. But as the director of the National Museum, he was, in Bottando's opinion, one of the wonders of the world. His elevation had come on the rebound; his predecessor had been go-getting, dynamic, determined to drag the musty museum into modernity, and was shortly to be let out of jail. The embarrassment had been considerable, and Macchioli -- who could not only resist temptation but probably wouldn't even notice he was being tempted -- had seemed the obvious successor, in the circumstances. A safe pair of hands; back to the traditional values of connoisseurship, erudition, and old-time curating. A universally beloved figure, in fact, but quite incapable of defending his patch against the incursions of bureaucrats who wished to cut his funds, to ooze up to potential benefactors, or to manage his disorganized museum. </p><p> And deeply unhappy, Flavia judged from the nervous way he came in, thrusting his bicycle clips into the bulging pocket of his shabby suit. It was all most intriguing. </p><p> Macchioli sat down, fiddled with his hands, and looked uncomfortable as the introductions were made. </p><p> "Perhaps we might begin?" the prime minister prompted. </p><p> "Ah, yes," Macchioli said absently. </p><p> "You have a problem that you wish to tell the signora about?" </p><p> Persuading himself to divulge it was evidently a titanic struggle, almost as though he knew that, once he had spoken, all sorts of unpleasant consequences might begin to swirl around him. He rocked to and fro, hunched his shoulders, rubbed his nose, and then, in a sudden burst of decision, spoke: "I've lost a picture. The museum has. It was stolen." </p><p> Flavia was puzzled. She could see why he was upset. Awkward business, losing pictures. That was not the problem, however. They went missing all the time; so often, in fact, that the routine for what to do was well established. You phoned the police. They went around, did their stuff and then you forgot all about it, on the reasonable grounds that the picture was unlikely ever to be seen again. All perfectly normal. It was hearing about it in the prime minister's office that was not entirely orthodox. </p><p> "I see," she said helpfully, but poor old Macchioli did not take it as a prompt to continue; instead he lapsed into another agonized silence. </p><p> "For the last five years, you see, we have been planning an exhibition." He restarted, evidently deciding that a sidelong approach might be best. "To celebrate Italy's presidency of the European Community, which begins in fifteen days' time. Drawing on all aspects of European art, but I am afraid that some people" -- and here he gave a surreptitious glance in the direction of the desk at which the prime minister was sitting -- "some people have sought to turn it into a nationalistic demonstration." </p><p> "Just a small reminder of our contribution in matters of culture," the prime minister purred. </p><p> "This has made borrowing the works a little more difficult than it might have been," Macchioli continued. "Not that it is relevant to the disaster that has befallen us..." </p><p> The prime minister, showing more patience than his reputation would have suggested possible, sighed in the background. It was enough to bring Macchioli's errant mind back to the immediate issue. </p><p> "We did, however, finally arrange to borrow nearly all the paintings we wanted. Most from Italian institutions, naturally, but a good proportion from foreign museums and owners. Many of the pictures have never been seen in this country before." </p><p> "But I know about all this," said Flavia with more impatience than the prime minister was showing. "We've been involved in the planning for years. Members of my department escorted the first few paintings from the airport to the museum last week." </p><p> "Yes. And a very fine job you did, too. No mistake about that. Very fine. Unfortunately..." </p><p> "The one you've had stolen. It was one of those?" </p><p> He nodded. </p><p> "When?" </p><p> "Yesterday. At lunchtime." </p><p> "Lunchtime? Then why are you only telling me about it now?" </p><p> "It was very awkward, you see. I wasn't at all sure what to do about it..." </p><p> "Perhaps I might fill the signora in?" The prime minister interrupted, glancing at his watch and realizing that, unless something was done soon, this meeting might last for the rest of the day and Macchioli still wouldn't have explained anything. "Please correct me if I get the details wrong. I understand the picture was stolen at around half past one yesterday. A hooded man reversed a truck into the storage area, held up the people working there, forced them to load the painting, complete with its frame, into the back of the truck, and drove off. Is that correct?" </p><p> Macchioli nodded. </p><p> Flavia, fidgeting around in her seat, opened her mouth to make the obvious protests about wasted time, trails going cold, and so on. </p><p> "Your department, signora, was not called because the thief left behind a message saying that the police should not be contacted." </p><p> "A ransom demand, is that it?" </p><p> A shrug. "Not exactly. Just that we'd be hearing more in due course. I suppose that means money." </p><p> "Maybe so. What, exactly, is the picture?" </p><p> "It's a Claude Lorrain. <i>Landscape with Cephalus and Procris,"</i> Macchioli said reluctantly. </p><p> Flavia paused. "Oh, not <i>that</i> one, surely? Not the one where the government intervened officially to guarantee it?" </p><p> He nodded. You could see why he was upset, she thought. Not that it was such a great picture, although she always found Claude quite toothsome. Not a Raphael, or anything like that. But it had such a dodgy past. Its reputation as one of the most stolen pictures in the world ensured it a status beyond its simple quality. Argyll, no doubt, would remember the details better than she could, but she could recall the highlights. Painted in the 1630s for an Italian cardinal. Pinched by the duke of Modena when he found it in a wagon after a battle. Pinched again by a French general a few years later. Looted and sold during the French Revolution, pinched again by Napoleon when he came across it in Holland. Stolen by thieves in the 1930s, by the Germans in the 1940s, and by two more thieves in the 1950s and 1960s. Whereupon the exasperated owner sold it to the Louvre, in the hope that they would manage to hang on to it. Which they had. Until, it seemed, it had arrived in Italy. </p><p> "Oh, dear," she said. </p><p> "You see our problem," the prime minister continued. "It is exceptionally unpleasant for me, as I gave a personal guarantee about its safety. Quite apart from that, this exhibition is to be one of the cultural high points of our presidency. It would be very bad indeed if it was wrecked, and it would be wrecked if this news gets out.

We would look quite ridiculous." </p><p> Flavia nodded. "So? When you get the ransom demand you pay up." </p><p> "The only problem is that it is illegal. If we arrest people for paying ransoms to rescue their wives and children, we can hardly pay up for a mere painting." </p><p> A silence fell on the room, and it seemed as though Flavia was expected to say something useful. </p><p> "You mean you want me to find the painting?" </p><p> "I would ordinarily be deeply grateful, but in this case, no. How many people would you use for such an inquiry?" </p><p> Flavia thought for a moment. "Everyone we had, if you wanted a quick result. Not that I can guarantee one." </p><p> "And could you at least guarantee to keep it out of the press?" </p><p> "For about six hours, yes." </p><p> "Precisely. Secrecy in this matter is absolutely vital. Even if you were successful and recovered the painting swiftly, the damage would still be done." </p><p> "In which case, I confess to being defeated.

As the author of this inspirational true story, Albom uses verbal inflection in exactly the right places to evoke humor, empathy, and emotion. It's an honest reading, and the underlying timbre of private memory pushes it past mere recitation to pure storytelling.<p> The titular Morrie was Morrie Schwartz, Albom's university professor 20 years before the events being narrated. An accidental viewing of an interview with Morrie on <i>Nightline</i> led Albom to become reunited with his old teacher, friend, and "coach" at a time when Albom, a successful sportswriter, was struggling to define dissatisfactions with his own life and career. Morrie, on the other hand, after a rich life filled with friends, family, teaching, and music, was dying from Lou Gehrig's disease, a crippling illness that diminished his activities daily. Albom was one of hundreds of former students and acquaintances who traveled great distances to visit Morrie in the final months of his life.</p><p> The 14 Tuesday visits that followed their reunion took Albom--and will take listeners with him--on a journey of reawakening to life's best rewards. The story is told in a journalistic style that never crosses into pathos. That a professional writer can write well is not surprising, but Albom also reads well, with clear enunciation and a talent for mimicry. Another reader might have interpreted the professor's aphorisms as droll humor or wrung a wrong note at an inappropriate moment, making the story a maudlin tearjerker; instead it is read for what it is, a tribute to a remarkable teacher.

The book is meant to enrich, not repeat, the work of existing texts on this period, and its focus on people makes it stand out from other books that have concentrated on the political and economic aspects of the culture. This text provides a detailed look at the cultural development of colonial Latin America using readings, documents, historical analysis, and visual materials, including photographs, drawings, and paintings. The book makes interesting and exciting use of the illustrations and documents, which show social changes, puzzling developments, and the experience of living in the colonial society. Religion and society are the integral themes of <i>Colonial Spanish America.</i> Religion becomes the nexus for much of what has been treated as political, social, economic, and cultural history during this period. Society is just as inclusive, allowing the reader to meet a variety of individuals-not faceless social groups. While some familiar faces and voices are included-namely those of Spanish conquerors, chroniclers, and missionaries-other, less familiar points of view complement and complicate the better-known narratives of this history. In treating Iberia and America, before as well as after their meeting, apparent contradictions emerge as opportunities for understanding; different perspectives become prompts for wider discussion. Other themes include exploration; military and spiritual conquest; and the formation, consolidation, reform, and collapse of colonial institutions of government and the Church, and the accompanying changes in the economy and labor.<br><br> <i>Colonial Spanish America: A Documentary History</i> is an excellent tool for Latin American history survey courses.</p><p>William B.

He received his Ph.D. in 1985 from the University of Chicago, and has been reading comic books for much longer.*Starred Review* In revolutionizing modern science, Erwin Schr�dinger and Werner Heisenberg somehow neglected the exciting plots and images of science fiction and comic books. Not to worry. Kakalios has now remedied that curious lapse. Indeed, Kakalios sees kindred kinds of imaginative daring in the appearance of the first science-fiction pulp magazine in the same year (1926) that Schr�dinger and Heisenberg published their paradigm-shaping discoveries. This improbable connection between abstruse science and popular culture brings Buck Rogers, Dr. Manhattan (of the Watchmen), Dick Tracy, and&#x2014;yes&#x2014;even Dagwood into a no-tears foray into the theoretical physics that opened the world of lasers, laptop computers, DVDs, and cell phones. Though the book does not quite live up to the subtitle&#x2019;s promise of a &#x201c;math-free&#x201d; text, readers need no more than basic algebra to accompany comic-book heroes into well-illustrated explanations of quantum packets of light energy, of the wave functions of particles, and even of the angular spin inherent in both energy and matter. These basic principles illuminate the solid-state physics of semiconductors, the atomic magnetism of MRIs, and the nanotechnology of high-capacity storage batteries.

Tolkien: A Biography</h2><p>The authorized biography of the creator of Middle-earth. In the decades since his death in September 1973, millions have read THE HOBBIT, THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and THE SILMARILLION and become fascinated about the very private man behind the books. Born in South Africa in January 1892, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was orphaned in childhood and brought up in near-poverty. He served in the first World War, surviving the Battle of the Somme, where he lost many of the closest friends he'd ever had. After the war he returned to the academic life, achieving high repute as a scholar and university teacher, eventually becoming Merton Professor of English at Oxford where he was a close friend of C.S. Lewis and the other writers known as The Inklings.<br><br>Then suddenly his life changed dramatically. One day while grading essay papers he found himself writing 'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit' -- and worldwide renown awaited him.<br><br>Humphrey Carpenter was given unrestricted access to all Tolkien's papers, and interviewed his friends and family. From these sources he follows the long and painful process of creation that produced THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE SILMARILLION and offers a wealth of information about the life and work of the twentieth century's most cherished author.</p><p>There may be a corner of the world where the name J.R.R. Tolkien is unknown, but you would be hard-pressed to find it. Since their publication, <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> have been published in every major language of the world. And though he single-handedly gave a mythology to the English and was beloved by millions, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien remained refreshingly unchanged by his fame and fortune, living out his days simply and modestly among the familiar surroundings of Oxford College. Humphrey Carpenter, who was given unrestricted access to Tolkien's papers, brilliantly puts meat to the bones of the Tolkien legend in <i>J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography</i>, offering a well-rounded portrayal of this quiet, bookish man who always saw himself first and foremost as a philologist, uncovering rather than creating the peoples, languages, and adventures of Middle-Earth.<p> Carpenter chronicles Tolkien's early life with a special sensitivity; after losing both parents, Tolkien and his brother Hilary were taken from their idyllic life in the English countryside to a poverty-ridden existence in dark and sooty Birmingham. There were bright points, however. A social and cheerful lad, Tolkien enjoyed rugby and was proud of his gift for languages. It was also at this time that he met Edith Bratt, who would later become his wife. Academic life--both as a student and professor--is where this biography shines. Friendship with other men played a huge part in Tolkien's life, and Carpenter deftly reveals the importance these relationships--his complex friendship with C.S. Lewis, membership in the Inklings and the T.C.B.S.--had on the development of his writing.</p><p> The only criticism one can make about this book is that Carpenter tends to gloss over Tolkien's contributions to comparative philology. True, there is a chapter devoted to Tolkien's academic pursuits, but it tends to skim too lightly over the surface for this reviewer's tastes. Philology is a terribly methodical science, and the author clearly did not want to alienate readers who were primarily interested in Tolkien as a storyteller. Still, it would be nice to understand why Tolkien was held in such high esteem by his fellow academics. As it stands, Tolkien comes off as a slightly eccentric etymologist.</p><p> Fans who want to delve even deeper into Tolkien's life should pick up a copy of Carpenter's <i>The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien</i>. <i>--P.M. Atterberry</i></p>Humphrey Carpenter, the author of THE BRIDESHEAD GENERATION and THE INKLINGS, among other books, was given unrestricted access to all of Tolkien&#39;s papers for his biography of Tolkien, J.R.R. TOLKIEN: A BIOGRAPHY.</p><h2>Portraits of a Marriage</h2><p>A rediscovered masterwork from the famed Hungarian novelist S�ndor M�rai, <i>Portraits of a Marriage</i> is in fact a startling exploration of a triangle of entanglement.<br><br>A wealthy couple in bourgeois society, Peter and Ilonka appear to enjoy a fine union. Their home is tastefully decorated; their clothes are well tailored; they move in important circles. And yet, to hypersensitive Ilonka, her choice in d�cor is never good enough, and her looks are never fair enough to fully win the love of her husband, who has carried with him a secret that has long tormented him: Peter is in love with Judit, a peasant and servant in his childhood home. For Judit, however, even Peter&#x2019;s affection cannot transcend that which she loves most&#x2014;the prospect of her own freedom and a future without the constraints of the society that has ensnared all three in a vortex of love and loss.<br><br>Set against the backdrop of Hungary between the wars, <i>Portraits of a Marriage</i> offers further &#x201c;posthumous evidence of [M�rai&#x2019;s] neglected brilliance&#x201d; (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>) and his exquisite, acutely observed evocations of sacrifice and longing.</p><p><b>S�ndor M�rai</b> was born in Kassa, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, in 1900, and died in San Diego, California, in 1989. He rose to fame as one of the leading literary novelists in Hungary in the 1930s. Profoundly antifascist, he survived the war, but persecution by the Communists drove him from the country in 1948, first to Italy, then to the United States.Look, see that man? Wait! turn your head away, look at me, keep talking. I wouldn&#x2019;t like it if he glanced this way and spotted me; I don&#x2019;t want him to greet us. Now you can look again . . . The little squat one there in the fur-collared coat? No, of course not. It&#x2019;s the tall, pale-faced one in the black overcoat talking to that blond stick of a girl behind the counter. He is just having some candied orange peel wrapped. Strange, he never bought me candied orange peel.<br><br>What&#x2019;s that, dear? . . . Nothing. Wait, I have to blow my nose.<br><br>Has he gone? Tell me when he has gone.<br><br>He&#x2019;s paying now? . . . Can you see what his wallet looks like? Describe it carefully; I don&#x2019;t want to look that way. Is it brown crocodile skin? Yes? Oh, I&#x2019;m so pleased.<br><br>Why am I pleased? Just because. Well, yes, of course, I gave him the wallet, for his birthday. Ten years ago. Was I in love with him? . . . That&#x2019;s a hard question, dear. Yes, I believe I did love him. Has he gone yet?<br><br>Good, I&#x2019;m glad he&#x2019;s gone. Wait, I must powder my nose. Does it show that I have been crying? . . . It&#x2019;s stupid, I know, but see how stupid people can be? My heart still beats faster when I see him. Can I tell you who he is? I can tell you, darling, It&#x2019;s no secret. That man was my husband.<br><br>Come on, let&#x2019;s get some pistachio ice cream. I really can&#x2019;t understand why people say you can&#x2019;t eat ice cream in winter. I love this patisserie best in winter for the ice cream. There are times I almost believe that anything possible to be done should be done, not just because it&#x2019;s good or makes sense, simply because it&#x2019;s possible. For some years now in any case, ever since I&#x2019;ve been alone, I&#x2019;ve enjoyed coming here between five and seven in the winter. I like the crimson d�cor, the Victorian furnishings, the old waitresses, the big metropolitan square beyond the shopwindow, watching the customers arrive. There&#x2019;s a sort of warmth about it all, just a touch of fin-de-si�cle. And there&#x2019;s no better tea anywhere, have you noticed? . . . I know the new generation of women don&#x2019;t go to patisseries. The prefer espressos, places where you have to rush, where there are no comfortable chairs, where it costs forty fill�r for one black coffee, where they can eat salad for lunch, that&#x2019;s how it is now. But it&#x2019;s not my world. What I want is refined patisseries like this, with such furniture, with crimson carpets, with their ancient countesses and princesses, their mirrored cupboards. As you may imagine, I&#x2019;m not here every day, but I do call in during the winter and feel comfortable here. My husband and I used to meet here pretty regularly, about six o&#x2019;clock, at teatime, after he finished at the office.<br><br>Oh yes, he was on his way home from the office just now. It&#x2019;s twenty after seven, his home time. I am familiar with every part of his routine, even now, as if it were his life I was living. At five minutes before six he rings for the office boy who brushes him down and presents him with his hat and coat, and he leaves the office, sending the car ahead so he can walk behind it and get some air. He doesn&#x2019;t do much walking, that&#x2019;s why he is so pale. Or there may be some other reason, I don&#x2019;t know now. I don&#x2019;t know the reason because I never see him, don&#x2019;t talk to him, haven&#x2019;t talked to him for three years. I don&#x2019;t like those prissy little separations where the two parties walk arm-in-arm from the court, dine together at that famous restaurant in the park, are tender and solicitous toward each other as if nothing had happened and then, after divorce and dinner, go their own ways. I&#x2019;m not that sort of woman: my morality, my blood pressure won&#x2019;t allow it. I don&#x2019;t believe that men and women can be good friends after divorce. Marriage is marriage; divorce, divorce. That&#x2019;s what I think.<br><br>But what do you think? True, you&#x2019;ve never been married.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t think that relationships people have entered on and nurtured for decades, vows they have unthinkingly kept, are empty formalities, you see. I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I think divorce is a kind of sacrilege. That&#x2019;s how I was brought up. But I believe it anyway, not just because of my upbringing, but because my religion demands that I believe it. I believe it because I am a woman and a divorce is no mere formality for me any more than the ritual in the church before the registrar is a formality: either it binds people together, body and soul, for once and for all, or it divides them, absolutely, and sends them their utterly separate ways. Not for one minute did I console myself with the thought that my husband and I would remain &#x201c;friends&#x201d; after our divorce. He was courteous, of course, and remained concerned for me, and generous too, as custom dictates that he should be. Not me, though. I was neither polite nor generous. I even took the piano, yes, as was my right. I was furious for revenge, and would happily have taken the whole house, right down to the curtains&#x2014;everything. The moment we divorced I became his enemy and I remain so, as I will till the day I die. I don&#x2019;t want a friendly invitation to dinner at the restaurant in the park from him; I don&#x2019;t want to play the little woman, to be delicate, to be someone who visits her ex-husband&#x2019;s home and looks after things when the servant steals his linen. I wouldn&#x2019;t care if they stole the lot, everything, nor would I rush over to him if I heard he was ill. Why? Because we are divorced, you understand? It&#x2019;s not something to which one can become resigned.<br><br>Wait, I withdraw what I just said about him being ill. I wouldn&#x2019;t want him to fall ill. If he did I would visit him in the sanatorium. What are you laughing at? Are you laughing at me? Do you think I&#x2019;m hoping he&#x2019;ll fall ill so I can visit him? Well, of course I hope that. As long as I have hope, I will carry on hoping. But I wouldn&#x2019;t want him to be too ill. He was so very pale, did you notice? . . . He has been pale like that for some years now.<br><br>I&#x2019;ll tell you everything. Have you got the time? Sadly, I have all too much.<br><br>Look, here&#x2019;s the ice cream. After school, I found a job in an office. We were still writing to each other then, weren&#x2019;t we? You went straight off to America but we carried on writing for a while, for three or four years, I think. I remember, there was an unhealthy, foolish puppy love between us. I rather disapprove of that now. It seems we can&#x2019;t live without love. But then it was you I loved. In any case, your family was rich while we lived in three rooms and a kitchen opening onto a corridor&#x2014;very much a middle-class kind of apartment opening onto a corridor. I looked up to you and that kind of admiration, I now realize, is already a sign of emotional attachment with young people. I too had a nanny but mine had to get her hot water secondhand, after I&#x2019;d finished my bath. Such details are very important. There are frighteningly many shades of gentility between poverty and wealth. And from poverty down, how many shades of poverty do you think there are? You are wealthy, so you can&#x2019;t know the enormous difference between four hundred and six hundred a month. It&#x2019;s a bigger difference than between two thousand and ten thousand a month. I know a great deal about this now. Back home, our income was eight hundred. My husband earned six and a half thousand per month. One had to get used to this.<br><br>Everything was just a little different in their home compared with ours. We lived in a rented apartment; they in a rented villa. We had a balcony with geraniums; they had a little garden with two flower beds and an old walnut tree. We had an ordinary icebox that we filled with ice in summer, while my mother-in-law had a small electric refrigerator that could produce nice neat ice cubes too. We had a general handyman working for us; they had a married couple, a servant and a cook. We had three rooms; they had four, five in fact if you include the hall. But their hall was a proper hall with light chiffon covers on the doors, whereas ours was only an entrance hall with the icebox in it&#x2014;a dark, urban Pest kind of entrance hall, together with a brush rack and old-fashioned coat stand. We had a three-valve radio set assembled by Papa from individually bought components, which received whatever station it felt like receiving; they had a radiogram, which was both a radio&#x2014;on which you could even pick up Japan&#x2014;and a gramophone, which worked by electricity and changed records automatically. I was brought up to earn my living; he was brought up, first and foremost, to live a refined, polite kind of life, one according to important social rules. Conformity was vital. There was an enormous social difference between us but I didn&#x2019;t know it then.<br><br>There was a conversation we had over breakfast once. &#x201c;Those mauve covers in the dining room are a little tiring,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They are quite crude and loud, like people who are always shouting at each other. Take a look round town, my dear, and find some different covers in time for fall.&#x201d;<br><br>Twelve chairs needed recovering in some less &#x201c;tiring&#x201d; color.<br><br>I looked at him in confusion. I thought he was joking. But it was no joke&#x2014;he carried on reading the papers with a perfectly serious expression. I could see that he had clearly thought through what he had just said, that the mauve color&#x2014;a little common, I must admit&#x2014;really did irritate him. My mother had chosen it. It was brand-new. I cried when he left. I&#x2019;m not completely stupid; I understood perfectly what he meant . . . What he wanted to say was something that could never be said directly, in plain, simple words: that there was a gulf in culture between us, that his world was not mine; that though I knew everything and had learned all there was to le...</p><h2>Christopher&#39;s Ghosts</h2><p>It is the late 1930s, and young Christopher and his family are struggling against the rise of Nazi totalitarianism in Berlin.

In December 1999, we learned that the teenage killers specifically targeted Rachel Scott and mocked her Christian faith on their chilling, homemade videotapes. Rachel Scott died for her faith. Now her parents talk about Rachel's life and how they have found meaning in their daughter's martyrdom in the aftermath of the school shooting. <i>Rachel's Tears</i> comes from a heartfelt need to celebrate this young girl's life, to work through the grief and the questions of a nation, and to comfort those who have been touched by violence in our schools today. Using excerpts and drawings from Rachel's own journals, her parents offer a spiritual perspective on the Columbine tragedy and provide a vision of hope for preventing youth violence across the nation.</p></p><p>Beth Nimmo is the mother of Rachel Scott, the first victim killed at Columbine High School.

Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. We are all susceptible to biases that can lead us to make bad decisions that make us poorer, less healthy and less happy. And, as Thaler and Sunstein show, no choice is ever presented to us in a neutral way. By knowing how people think, we can make it easier for them to choose what is best for them, their families and society. Using dozens of eye-opening examples the authors demonstrate how to nudge us in the right directions, without restricting our freedom of choice. &#34;Nudge&#34; offers a unique new way of looking at the world for individuals and governments alike. This is one of the most engaging, provocative and important books you will ever read.</p><p><p></p><p></p><strong>Questions for Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein</strong> <br><br> <b>Amazon.com:</b> What do you mean by "nudge" and why do people sometimes need to be nudged?<p> <b>Thaler and Sunstein:</b> By a nudge we mean anything that influences our choices. A school cafeteria might try to nudge kids toward good diets by putting the healthiest foods at front. We think that it's time for institutions, including government, to become much more user-friendly by enlisting the science of choice to make life easier for people and by gentling nudging them in directions that will make their lives better.<br></p><p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> What are some of the situations where nudges can make a difference? </p><p> <b>Thaler and Sunstein:</b> Well, to name just a few: better investments for everyone, more savings for retirement, less obesity, more charitable giving, a cleaner planet, and an improved educational system. We could easily make people both wealthier and healthier by devising friendlier choice environments, or architectures. <br></p><p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> Can you describe a nudge that is now being used successfully? </p><p> <b>Thaler and Sunstein:</b> One example is the Save More Tomorrow program. Firms offer employees who are not saving very much the option of joining a program in which their saving rates are automatically increased whenever the employee gets a raise. This plan has more than tripled saving rates in some firms, and is now offered by thousands of employers. <br></p><p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> What is "choice architecture" and how does it affect the average person's daily life?</p><p> <b>Thaler and Sunstein:</b> Choice architecture is the context in which you make your choice. Suppose you go into a cafeteria. What do you see first, the salad bar or the burger and fries stand? Where's the chocolate cake? Where's the fruit? These features influence what you will choose to eat, so the person who decides how to display the food is the choice architect of the cafeteria. All of our choices are similarly influenced by choice architects. The architecture includes rules deciding what happens if you do nothing; what's said and what isn't said; what you see and what you don't. Doctors, employers, credit card companies, banks, and even parents are choice architects.<br><br> We show that by carefully designing the choice architecture, we can make dramatic improvements in the decisions people make, without forcing anyone to do anything. For example, we can help people save more and invest better in their retirement plans, make better choices when picking a mortgage, save on their utility bills, and improve the environment simultaneously. Good choice architecture can even improve the process of getting a divorce--or (a happier thought) getting married in the first place!<br> </p><p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> You are very adamant about allowing people to have choice, even though they may make bad ones. But if we know what's best for people, why just nudge? Why not push and shove?</p><p> <b>Thaler and Sunstein:</b> Those who are in position to shape our decisions can overreach or make mistakes, and freedom of choice is a safeguard to that. One of our goals in writing this book is to show that it is possible to help people make better choices and retain or even expand freedom. If people have their own ideas about what to eat and drink, and how to invest their money, they should be allowed to do so. <br> </p><p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> You point out that most people spend more time picking out a new TV or audio device than they do choosing their health plan or retirement investment strategy? Why do most people go into what you describe as "auto-pilot mode" even when it comes to making important long-term decisions?</p><p> <b>Thaler and Sunstein:</b> There are three factors at work. First, people procrastinate, especially when a decision is hard. And having too many choices can create an information overload. Research shows that in many situations people will just delay making a choice altogether if they can (say by not joining their 401(k) plan), or will just take the easy way out by selecting the default option, or the one that is being suggested by a pushy salesman. <br><br> Second, our world has gotten a lot more complicated. Thirty years ago most mortgages were of the 30-year fixed-rate variety making them easy to compare. Now mortgages come in dozens of varieties, and even finance professors can have trouble figuring out which one is best. Since the cost of figuring out which one is best is so hard, an unscrupulous mortgage broker can easily push unsophisticated borrowers into taking a bad deal. <br><br> Third, although one might think that high stakes would make people pay more attention, instead it can just make people tense. In such situations some people react by curling into a ball and thinking, well, err, I'll do something else instead, like stare at the television or think about baseball. So, much of our lives is lived on auto-pilot, just because weighing complicated decisions is not so easy, and sometimes not so fun. Nudges can help ensure that even when we're on auto-pilot, or unwilling to make a hard choice, the deck is stacked in our favor.<br> </p><p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Are we humans just poorly adapted for making sound judgments in an increasingly fast-paced and complex world? What can we do to position ourselves better?</p><p> <b> Thaler and Sunstein:</b> The human brain is amazing, but it evolved for specific purposes, such as avoiding predators and finding food. Those purposes do not include choosing good credit card plans, reducing harmful pollution, avoiding fatty foods, and planning for a decade or so from now. Fortunately, a few nudges can help a lot. A few small hints: Sign up for automatic payment plans so you don t pay late fees. Stop using your credit cards until you can pay them off on time every month. Make sure you're enrolled in a 401(k) plan. A final hint: Read <i>Nudge</i>. <br> </p> <br><br> <b>Review</b><br> "How often do you read a book that is both important and amusing, both practical and deep?

Medical illustrator, writer, and part-time tattoo artist Gilbert seeks to explore the historical depth and aesthetic variations of tattoos as permanent body decoration. The text consists mostly of excerpts from the works of anthropologists, explorers, physicians, artists, and others and dates from Greek and Roman times to the present. The organization can be confusing, but Gilbert provides contextual essays for individual chapters, which are arranged primarily geographically, with the deepest coverage on Oceania, Japan, and Europe/America. The illustrations, ranging from crude line drawings to full-color photos, are perhaps the most fascinating element in the book. Unlike some books on tattooing, the images do not emphasize the salacious. While the text is not academic in tone, Gilbert supports his research with an extensive reference citation list and bibliography. Capable of entertaining and enlightening both young enthusiasts and anthropologists, this is recommended for both public and academic libraries. Eugene C.

Fresh from the farms in Italy, Lucia Santa struggles to hold her family together in a strange land. At turns poignant, comic and violent, and with a new preface by the author, The Fortunate Pilgrim is Italian-American fiction at its very best.</p><p><br>"A classic . . . The novel is lifted into literature by its highly charged language, its penetrating insights, and its mixture of tenderness and rage."<br>--The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"A beautiful book with perfect sentences, a book that could have put Puzo on track to be the Italian Malamud or Henry Roth."<br>--New York magazine<br><br>"An accomplished and imaginative writer."<br>--Los Angeles Times<br><br>"It reads almost as a prequel to The Godfather. . . . [with] the same endearing style that makes almost any Puzo book difficult to put down."<br>--Detroit News and Free Press<br>Mario Puzo was born in New York and, following military service in World War II, attended New York&#x2019;s New School for Social Research and Columbia University.

He has also written the screenplays for all three Godfather movies, for which he received two Academy Awards.</p><h2>A Light in the Storm: The Civil War Diary of Amelia Martin (Dear America)</h2><p>Captures the emotions of a young Union girl who struggles to make sense of her shattered world as she lives in a state of harsh division during the first year of the Civil War. 120,000 first printing.</p><p>This engaging addition to the successful Dear America series follows the adventures of Amelia Martin, a lighthouse keeper's daughter living on an island off the coast of Delaware in 1861. Amelia helps her father keep the light and her mother keep the house, but she cannot keep their marriage together. Newbery Medal recipient Karen Hesse (<i>Out of the Dust</i>) cleverly personifies the conflict between North and South, abolitionist and secessionist, Union and Confederacy in the troubled marriage of Amelia's parents. Amelia watches, powerless, as the relationship disintegrates: "I feel as if I am the Light in my family. I must keep my hope burning, so that Father and Mother, even in the darkness that seems to engulf them, might find their way back."<p> The broken marriage provides a powerful example of the way the Civil War tore apart families and friendships. Girls will thrill to Amelia's descriptions of her tomboyish responsibilities as lighthouse keeper and family breadwinner, her burgeoning love affair with a local boy, and her friendship with her abolitionist uncle. While some of the language and details seem anachronistic, Hesse has crafted a remarkably elegant tale of "girl as emotional beacon," tirelessly watching as her world crashes on the shoals.

Her titles include the Newbery Medal winner Out of the Dust, Witness, and The Cats in Krasinski Square, among many others.

He has carried out his double ministry over the past twenty-five years in settings of extreme poverty, violence, social upheaval, and natural disasters. This personal experience of tough realities has been at once a descent into chaos and an ascent into compassion, never more so than in his work in Haiti.</p> <p>The reflections in this volume are less about Haiti than they are about real-life incidents that happened there, during a particular time in history. In a fuller sense, these reflections shed light on what happens in any place, at any time, to people of any race or class, who live out an assault on their human dignity. Whenever the dignity of human beings is marred, the human spirit finds itself in threatened conditions, and seeks desperately to preserve what is human about it. This is the unfailing light of God&#x2019;s grace, ever present and faithful, fiercely persistent in trying to renew the face of the earth and the pilgrim human heart.</p> <p>Grounded in space and time, and yet speaking of universal concerns, this very personal volume shows how the ancient human scourges of poverty, ignorance, illness, and violence desecrate humanity and weaken the spirit. Yet as Frechette shows, from these ashes many people, with the help of God, valiantly rise. This is a stunning work that crosses conventional barriers between the personal and the political, between degradation by others and elevation by selves.</p> <p>&#x201c;I will lead you by the way.... that you may become the brother of God and learn to know the Christ of the burnt men.&#x201d; <em><em> &#x2013;</em></em>Thomas Merton</p></p><p><p> <em>Richard Frechette</em> is a medical doctor and Catholic priest who directs the Haiti programs of Nuestros Pequenos Hermanos International, and of his religious community, The Passionists. These programs include orphanages, schools, a children&#x2019;s hospital, and mobile clinics in and around Port-au-Prince. He did similar work previously in Mexico and Honduras.</p><p> After reading HAITI, Oscar-winning writer-director Paul Haggis says of author Fr. Rich Frechette: "He is a man who does daily battle with cynicism and hatred that threatens to overwhelm his faith in mankind, and somehow draws lessons so surprising that they threaten to make an old atheist, like myself, believe in God." &nbsp;</p> <p> "Mother Teresa never sought fame&#x2014;she was content to simply care for the sick and indigent without notice or fanfare. While she was unique in many ways, she was not the first, or the last, of great Catholic heroes who are blessed with incredible humility. Father Richard Frechette is cut from the same cloth...&nbsp;<em>Haiti: The God of Tough Places, the Lord of Burnt Men</em> is a riveting volume that requires a strong stomach. But the rewards, especially for Catholics, make the struggle worthwhile.... What energizes him [Father Rick]&nbsp;is the Haitian people&#x2014;they never give up. Surrounded by horror stories, many of which are their own, they possess a will to live that would astound most of us in the developed nations."&nbsp;</p> <p> <em>&#x2013;</em>William A.

How often have we tried to analyze an unhealthy or unhappy relationship from a psychological perspective, only to find that this kind of interpretation doesn't "feel" right? Martin Schulman suggests that we can reach a deeper and more constructive understanding if we search out the karmic layers in our relationships - those attitudes, behaviors and beliefs which are residue from past lifetimes, and which stand in the way of our achieving harmony and balance, the prerequisites for enduring relationships using a karmic lens. He compares every possible combination of the major aspects, showing the reader how one facet of personality (represented by a planet ) compares to planets in your partner's chart. Where are the points of stress in your relationship? The capacity for ease? What are the lessons which can be learned as a result of this relationship, and what are the optimum ways to learn them? By viewing our relationships karmically, we can grow both spiritually and emotionally.<br> For those who believe that the way we love is the most important measure of the way we live, Schulman offers new tools which can help sustain us on the path to inspired, delightful, abiding love.</p><p></p><h2>Jews Without Money</h2><p>As a writer and political activist in early-twentieth-century America, Michael Gold was an important presence on the American cultural scene for more than three decades. Beginning in the 1920s his was a powerful journalistic voice for social change and human rights, and Jews Without Moneythe author&#39;s only novelis a passionate record of the times. First published in 1930, this fictionalized autobiography offered an unusually candid look at the thieves, gangsters, and ordinary citizens who struggled against brutal odds in lower East Side Manhattan. Like Henry Roth&#39;s Call It Sleep and Abraham Cahan&#39;s The Rise and Fall of David Levinsky, Jews Without Money is a literary landmark of the Jewish experience.</p><p>Michael Gold (1893&#x2013;1967) was born in New York City, where later he wrote for radical journals and newspapers such as New Masses and The Liberator. Jews Without Money has been translated in more than fourteen countries, including Germany, where the novel was employed against Nazi propaganda.&#34;A landmark; the first Jewish novel to make a dent on American culture.&#34;--Village Voice</p><h2>The Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of Paul Dirac, Quantum Genius</h2><p>Paul Dirac was one of the leading pioneers of the greatest revolution in 20th-century science: quantum mechanics. The youngest theoretician ever to win the Nobel Prize for Physics, he was also pathologically reticent, strangely literal-minded and legendarily unable to communicate or empathize. Through his greatest period of productivity, his postcards home contained only remarks about the weather. Based on a previously undiscovered archive of family papers, Graham Farmelo celebrates Dirac&#39;s massive scientific achievement while drawing a compassionate portrait of his life and work. Farmelo shows a man who, while hopelessly socially inept, could manage to love and sustain close friendship. &#34;The Strangest Man&#34; is an extraordinary and moving human story, as well as a study of one of the most exciting times in scientific history.</p><p>Graham Farmelo is a By-Fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge, and an Adjunct Professor of Physics at Northeastern University, Boston, USA. He edited the bestselling It Must be Beautiful: Great Equations of Modern Science in 2002. His biography of Paul Dirac, The Strangest Man, won the 2009 Costa Biography Award and the 2010 Los Angeles Times Science Book Prize.

Dirac was one of the great founding fathers of modern physics, a theoretician who explored the sub-atomic world through the power of pure mathematics. He was also a most extraordinary man - an extreme introvert, and perhaps autistic. Farmelo traces the outward events as authoritatively as the inward.

He was one of quantum mechanics&#x2019; founding fathers, an Einstein-level genius. He was also virtually incapable of having normal social interactions. Graham Farmelo&#x2019;s biography explains Dirac&#x2019;s mysterious life and work.&#x201d;<br> <br> <b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br> &#x201c;Farmelo did not pick the easiest biography to write &#x2013; its subject lived a largely solitary life in deep thought. But Dirac was also beset with tragedy... and in that respect, the author proposes some novel insights into what shaped the man. This would be a strong addition to a bibliography of magnificent 20th-century physicist biographies, including Walter Issacson&#x2019;s Einstein, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin&#x2019;s <i>American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J.

It would have been easy to simply fill the biography with Dirac stories of which there is a cornucopia, many of which are actually true. But Farmelo does much more than that. He has met and spoken with people who knew Dirac including the surviving members of his family. He has been to where Dirac lived and worked and he understands the physics. What has emerged is a 558 page biography, which is a model of the genre. Dirac was so private and emotionally self-contained that one wonders if anyone really knew him. Farmelo&#x2019;s book is as close as we are likely to come."<br> <br> <b><i>American Scientist</i></b><br> &#x201c;[A] highly readable and sympathetic biography of the taciturn British physicist who can be said, with little exaggeration, to have invented modern theoretical physics.

The text of this package includes capsule explanations of such events as the attack on Pearl Harbor and the death of Elvis, accompanied by dramatic black-and-white stock photos. Introduced by the sonorous voice of TV journalist Bill Kurtis, the recordings of the news broadcasts revive the panic and thrill of some of the defining moments (mostly American) of the 20th century.<p> <i>We Interrupt This Broadcast</i> offers, in some ways, a strange view of the past. News that interrupts broadcasts is always sensational, and usually tragic. Of the 39 recordings, only five or so don't involve assassinations, explosions, death or defeat; furthermore, only the deaths of Marilyn Monroe and Princess Diana represent the female side of modern events. Nevertheless, these recordings will fascinate many listeners too young to have heard the original broadcasts, and those who were alive might enjoy hearing them again in all their crackling, nostalgic glory. <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p>Author Joe Garner is a twenty-year veteran of the radio business, including eleven years as an executive with Westwood One, the international radio syndication company and owner of the NBC Radio Networks and Mutual Broadcasting System.

The boundaries of such institutions have grown fuzzy. They extend from a region where the audience is pumped for tweets to a future of &#x201c;neurocurating,&#x201d; in which paintings surveil their audience via facial recognition and eye tracking to assess their popularity and to scan for suspicious activity.<br><br> In <i>Duty Free Art</i>, filmmaker and writer Hito Steyerl wonders how we can appreciate, or even make art, in the present age.<br><br> What can we do when arms manufacturers sponsor museums, and some of the world&#x2019;s most valuable artworks are used as currency in a global futures market detached from productive work? Can we distinguish between information, fake news, and the digital white noise that bombards our everyday lives? Exploring subjects as diverse as video games, WikiLeaks files, the proliferation of freeports, and political actions, she exposes the paradoxes within globalization, political economies, visual culture, and the status of art production.</p></p><p><p><b>Hito Steyerl</b> is one of the leading artists working in video today.

She is currently a Professor of New Media Art at the Berlin University of the Arts.</p>&#x201c;Steyerl refuses to nail down a single idea or insist on a point of view. Instead, we get art&#x2014;her video&#x2014;as an act of moral thinking-in-progress. In a very of-the-moment, digital-age way, the logic of that thinking is fractured, the nature of morality suspect. But a belief in the necessity of thinking, restlessly, politically, never is in doubt.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;<i>New York Times</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;The highest duty of theory and art is to grasp and articulate their own time.

We enter a phase of life that we have no preparation for. No one tell us how to live with a life threatening illness or what to expect when cure is no longer possible and we are dealing with the ending of life. The End of Life Guideline Series is a compilation of Barbara Karnes&#39; four booklets on end of life. Beginning with the guidance A Time To Life offers to a person who has been diagnosed with a life threatening illness. The End of Life Guideline Series progresses to Gone From My Sight , The Hospice Blue Book, which explains the signs of approaching death that begin months before death from disease and leads a family to the moment of death. The Eleventh Hour offers information, ideas and support for a caregiver/family member who are often alone as their loved one is dying, on how to care for a person in the hours to minutes before death and just after. The final section of this complication is an exploration of the normal grieving process. What are the emotions and feelings that will surface as we grieve the loss of someone we care about and how will those emotions show themselves? The aim of this series is to neutralize some of the fear that an unpredictable future may bring. Knowledge of the dying process and it&#39;s natural and normal unfolding can help create a meaningful and comforting experience as a loved one journeys from life. It is written in a simple, direct yet gentle manner. It is a short and valuable read. Following a death we often have questions about the disease progression and concerned memories.

In The Gospel According to Jesus, MacArthur tackles the idea of &#39;easy believism,&#39; challenging Christians to re-evaluate their commitment to Christ by examining their fruits. MacArthur asks, &#39;What does it really mean to be saved?&#39; He urges readers to understand that their conversion was more than a mere point in time, that, by definition, it includes a lifetime of obediently walking with Jesus as Lord. This 20th Anniversary edition of MacArthur&#39;s provocative, Scripture-based book contains one new chapter and is further revised to provide Christians in the 21st century a fresh perspective on the intrinsic relationship between faith and works, clearly revealing why Jesus is both Savior and Lord to all who believe. nity.

In this collection of sixteen stories, he explores such wide-ranging contemporary themes as galvanism, time travel and resurrection of the dead. 'The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfall' relates a man's balloon journey to the moon with a combination of scientific precision and astonishing fantasy. Elsewhere, the boundaries between horror and science are elegantly blurred in stories such as 'The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar', while the great essay 'Eureka' outlines Poe's own interpretation of the universe. Powerfully influential on later authors including Jules Verne, these works are essential reading for anyone wishing to trace the genealogy of science fiction, or to understand the complexity of Poe's own creative vision.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Alice, Scarlet, Lulu, Beth, Harriet, and Ellen welcome Mary into their circle despite her reluctance to open her heart to them. Each woman teaches Mary a new knitting technique, and, as they do, they reveal to her their own personal stories of loss, love, and hope. Eventually, through the hours they spend knitting and talking together, Mary is finally able to tell her own story of grief, and in so doing reclaims her love for her husband, faces the hard truths about her relationship with her mother, and finds the spark of life again.

Protagonist Mary joins a knitting circle as a distraction after her daughter's sudden death. The people she meets there help her to come to terms with her tragedy. Hillary Huber is a capable reader whose strength lies in her phrasing and her use of a well-timed pause. Her voice is at its most pleasing when she uses it as a tool for narration rather than assuming the voices of the many characters. The novel is fraught with metaphors that liken knitting to life, and those comparisons neatly parallel each circle member's history.

Together they called upon the West to confront the spiritual, cultural, and political malaise that have afflicted it in the earliest years of the 21st century. In the months that ensued, before Cardinal Ratzinger's election to the papacy, they developed their ideas into the eloquent dialogue that is <i>Without Roots</i> - a book that quickly became an Italian bestseller and is even more timely today than ever. With Europe shaken by the war in Iraq, terrorism, security, Israel, relations with the U.S., immigration, and the rejection of the EU constitution in both France and the Netherlands, the issue of European identity has profound implications for the rest of the world. Bringing together their unique vantage points as leaders of Church and State, Pope Benedict XVI and Pera challenge us to imagine what can be the future of a civilization that has abandoned its history for a relativist secularism. They call on the West to embrace a spiritual rather than political renewal-and to accept the moral beliefs that alone can help us to make sense of changes in technology, economics, and society. Pope Benedict XVI joins the President of the Italian Senate to offer a provocative critique of the spiritual, cultural, and political crisis afflicting the West.</p><p><b>Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger</b> was the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under the late Pope John Paul II, and has long been regarded as one of the most profound Catholic theological and spiritual writers of our times. His numerous books include <i>God and the World</i>, <i>Introduction to Christianity</i>, <i>Salt of the Earth</i>, and <i>The Spirit of Liturgy</i>. <b>Marcello Pera</b>, a professor of the philosophy of science at the University of Pisa, is also President of the Italian Senate. He lives in Italy.Complementary lectures delivered in May 2004 and the lecturers' letters of response to one another make up a small, potent book on the topic that Bruce Bawer's startling <i>While Europe Slept</i> (2006) gives electrifying currency: the decline and all-too-possible fall of European culture to the radical Islam that Mary Habeck in <i>Knowing the Enemy</i> (2006) calls "jihadism." Pera, a philosopher of science who has become president of the Italian senate, dissects political correctness and the condition of which it is a symptom, cultural relativism. Ratzinger, who a year later became Pope Benedict XVI, summarizes Europe's Christian heritage with breathtaking concision and historical mastery. Both men see Europe today in a crisis of identity that has made it largely unable and unwilling to defend its culture against intransigent Islam, and both call for revivifying Christian identity. In his letter, Pera advocates nondenominational Christianity as the basis of a revitalized Europe; in his, Ratzinger propounds the conditions for a pan-European Christian civil religion such as Pera outlines. An engrossing, enlightening, extremely timely discussion. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Yet, as unbelievable as it sounds, there is a way to turn the daily stream of &#x201c;nos&#x201d; and &#x201c;don&#x2019;ts&#x201d; into &#x201c;yeses&#x201d; and hugs...if you know how to speak your toddler&#x2019;s language. In one of the most useful advances in parenting techniques of the past twenty-five years, Dr. Karp reveals that toddlers, with their immature brains and stormy outbursts, should be thought of not as pint-size people but as pintsize...cavemen. <br><br>Having noticed that the usual techniques often failed to calm crying toddlers, Dr. Karp discovered that the key to effective communication was to speak to them in their own primitive language. When he did, suddenly he was able to soothe their outbursts almost every time! This amazing success led him to the realization that children between the ages of one and four go through four stages of &#x201c;evolutionary&#x201d; growth, each linked to the development of the brain, and each echoing a step in prehistoric humankind&#x2019;s journey to civilization:<br><br>� The &#x201c;Charming Chimp-Child&#x201d; (12 to 18 months): Wobbles around on two legs, grabs everything in reach, plays a nonstop game of &#x201c;monkey see monkey do.&#x201d;<br>� The &#x201c;Knee-High Neanderthal&#x201d; (18 to 24 months): Strong-willed, fun-loving, messy, with a vocabulary of about thirty words, the favorites being &#x201c;no&#x201d; and &#x201c;mine.&#x201d;<br>� The &#x201c;Clever Caveman&#x201d; (24 to 36 months): <br>Just beginning to learn how to share, make friends, take turns, and use the potty.<br>� The &#x201c;Versatile Villager&#x201d; (36 to 48 months): Loves to tell stories, sing songs and dance, while trying hard to behave.<br><br>To speak to these children, Dr. Karp has developed two extraordinarily effective techniques:<br>1) The &#x201c;fast food&#x201d; rule&#x2014;restating what your child has said to make sure you got it right;<br>2) The four-step rule&#x2014;using gesture, repetition, simplicity, and tone to help your <br>irate Stone-Ager be happy again.<br><br>Once you&#x2019;ve mastered &#x201c;toddler-ese,&#x201d; you will be ready to apply behavioral techniques specific to each stage of your child&#x2019;s development, such as teaching patience and calm, doing time-outs (and time-ins), praise through &#x201c;gossiping,&#x201d; and many other strategies. Then all the major challenges of the toddler years&#x2014;including separation anxiety, sibling rivalry, toilet training, night fears, sleep problems, picky eating, biting and hitting, medicine taking <i>&#x2014; </i>can be handled in a way that will make your toddler feel understood. The result: fewer tantrums, less yelling, and, best of all, more happy, loving time for you and your child.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><b>You want help? This is r-e-a-l help!

But then the bubble burst. The financial sector was paralyzed and the economy contracted. State and federal governments struggled to pay their domestic and foreign creditors. Washington was incapable of decisive action. The country seethed with political and social unrest. In America's First Great Depression, Alasdair Roberts describes how the United States dealt with the economic and political crisis that followed the Panic of 1837.</p><p>As Roberts shows, the two decades that preceded the Panic had marked a democratic surge in the United States. However, the nation&#x2019;s commitment to democracy was tested severely during this crisis. Foreign lenders questioned whether American politicians could make the unpopular decisions needed on spending and taxing. State and local officials struggled to put down riots and rebellion. A few wondered whether this was the end of America&#x2019;s democratic experiment.</p><p>Roberts explains how the country&#x2019;s woes were complicated by its dependence on foreign trade and investment, particularly with Britain. Aware of the contemporary relevance of this story, Roberts examines how the country responded to the political and cultural aftershocks of 1837, transforming its political institutions to strike a new balance between liberty and social order, and uneasily coming to terms with its place in the global economy.</p></p><p><p>Alasdair Roberts is Jerome L.

Her most recent bestseller, <i>Save <i>Wisely, Spend Happily</i></i>, was released in 2013 in partnership with the AICPA.So why write <i>Think and Grow Rich for Women</i>?<br> &nbsp;<br> The rules of success are the same for everyone. Why mess with the brilliance of Napoleon Hill&#x2019;s original book, <i>Think and Grow Rich</i>? Why write something special just for women? <br> &nbsp;<br> These questions, and many more, are sure to be asked. In fact, for most of my career, I have felt the same way. I originally read <i>Think and Grow Rich </i>when I was nineteen and have read it many times during my career, and it has had a huge, positive impact on my life. <br> &nbsp;<br> My parents taught me that I could be anyone or do anything I wanted as long as I worked hard and focused on my goals. They had worked hard all their lives and were fabulous role models. It wasn&#x2019;t until I started my career, all alone in a different city, that reality started to set in. It was in the late 1970s and I was one of only a few women in my field. I quickly learned that I definitely had to work harder than my male counterparts if I wanted to get ahead. So I did. <br> &nbsp;<br> No one said it would be easy&#x2014;and it wasn&#x2019;t. No one said it would be a smooth ride&#x2014;and it hasn&#x2019;t been. But the resilience and lessons I learned from facing and surviving the tough times were essential contributors to my success today. <br> &nbsp;<br> Now, more than thirty-five years later, I continue to be amazed by the stories of the incredible businesswomen I meet and how they too, in the face of the glass ceiling or sexual bias, found ways to forge ahead. Many of them had read and followed the teachings of <i>Think and Grow Rich </i>and created great success in their lives, but they have gone even further. They have each taken their success in stride and continued on to open new paths for the women who follow them, evolving their lives of success into lives of significance. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Think and Grow Rich for Women </i>is a celebration of these women and every woman who has succeeded in spite of the obstacles she has encountered&#x2014;women who have changed history, created great business success, and provided great opportunities for others.<br> &nbsp;<br> In addition, there have been some incredible economic developments that have brought greater attention to successful women, and in doing so, have revealed that while the rules may be the same, women approach those rules differently, and they apply them differently than men do. While there is still much progress to be made, there has been a &#x201c;quiet revolution&#x201d; as women have gained momentum in every aspect of life. The following statistics showing the increasing power of women are the most recent available at the time of this writing.<br> &nbsp;<br> IN THE ECONOMY<br> &nbsp;<br> These financial statistics prove, without a doubt, that women have tremendous power and influence globally. Can you imagine what would happen if women came together and used their economic power to create positive change?<br> &nbsp;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60 percent of all personal wealth in the United States is held by women.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 85 percent of all consumer purchases in the United States are made by women.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women over the age of fifty have a combined net worth of $19 trillion.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two-thirds of consumer wealth in the United States will belong to women in the next decade.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $7 trillion is spent by women in the United States in consumer and business spending.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Globally, women are responsible for $20 trillion in spending, and that number is expected to rise to $28 trillion by the end of 2014.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Globally, women stand to inherit 70 percent of the $41 trillion in intergenerational wealth transfer expected over the next forty years.<br> &nbsp;<br> IN EDUCATION<br> &nbsp;<br> The United States Department of Education estimated that in 2013<br> women earned:<br> &nbsp;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 61.6 percent of all associate degrees;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 56.7 percent of all bachelor&#x2019;s degrees;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 59.9 percent of all master&#x2019;s degrees;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51.6 percent of all doctorate degrees.<br> &nbsp;<br> In summary, in 2013, 140 women graduated with a college degree at some level for every hundred men.<br> &nbsp;<br> IN THE CORPORATE WORLD<br> &nbsp;<br> While tremendous progress has been made in the lower ranks of management, there is still a great need for women to advance to the higher levels of leadership in corporations, which is evidence that the glass ceiling still needs to be shattered:<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are twenty-three, or 4.6 percent, women CEOs of Fortune 500 companies.8<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women hold 16.9 percent of board seats in the United States, as compared to 40.9 percent in Norway, and 6 percent in Asia.<br> o&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to note that Norway passed a law in 2003 requiring companies to appoint women to 40 percent of board posts.11<br> o&nbsp;&nbsp; A study of companies in the MSCI AC World index, which is an index designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets in twenty-four countries, found that companies with a gender-diverse board outperformed those with only men by 26 percent over six years.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women hold 14.6 percent of executive officer positions.<br> o&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a report by <i>Catalyst </i>titled &#x201c;The Bottom Line: Corporate Performance and Women&#x2019;s Representation on Boards,&#x201d; Fortune 500 companies with the highest representation of women board directors attained significantly higher financial performance, on average, than those with the lowest representation of women board directors. In addition, the report highlights that boards with three or more women directors show notably stronger-than-average performance. It shared three key measurements:<br> &#x25ca; <b>Return on Equity: </b>On average, companies with the highest percentages of women board directors outperformed those with the least by <b>53 percent</b>.<br> &#x25ca; <b>Return on Sales: </b>On average, companies with the highest percentages of women board directors outperformed those with the least by <b>42 percent</b>.<br> &#x25ca; <b>Return on Invested Capital: </b>On average, companies with the highest percentages of women board directors outperformed those with the least by <b>66 percent.</b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> IN EARNINGS<br> &nbsp;<br> While the overall statistics are still disturbing, when you dig into the detail, a positive trend emerges:<br> &nbsp;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women are paid an average of 77 cents for every dollar men make. In 1970, it was 59 cents. <br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the 77 cents statistic has remained constant over the last few years, a total of sixteen states report that their women are earning 80 cents or more for every dollar men make.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you exclude self-employed and workers who work only part of the year, in 2012 women earned 80.9 percent as much as men.<br> &nbsp;<br> And a review by age group shows significant improvement for younger women. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics:<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> PAY EQUITY BY AGE<br> &nbsp;<br> Age Groups Women&#x2019;s Percentage of Men&#x2019;s Earnings<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&#x2013;24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 93.2 percent<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25&#x2013;34 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 92.3 percent<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 35&#x2013;44 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 78.5 percent<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 45&#x2013;54 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 76.0 percent<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 55&#x2013;64 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;75.1 percent<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 65+ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 80.9 percent<br> &nbsp;<br> � Globally, men&#x2019;s median full-time earnings were 17.6 percent higher than women&#x2019;s in developing countries. The biggest gender wage gap was in Korea and Japan.<br> � Globally, according to a Deloitte study, women&#x2019;s earning power is growing faster than men&#x2019;s in developing countries. Their earned incomes have increased by 8.1 percent, compared with 5.8 percent for men.<br> &nbsp;<br> IN BUSINESS OWNERSHIP<br> &nbsp;<br> More and more women are shunning the corporate world in favor of entrepreneurship, thereby circumventing the impact of the glass ceiling altogether. The &#x201c;State of Women-Owned Businesses Report&#x201d; for 2013 (commissioned by American Express OPEN) reveals:<br> &nbsp;<br> � Between 1997 and 2013, the number of women-owned firms has grown at one and a half times the national average; <br> � The number of women-owned and equally owned firms is nearly 13.6 million and they:<br> &nbsp;<br> � generate more than $2.7 trillion in revenues;<br> � employ nearly 15.9 million people;<br> � represent 46 percent of U.S. firms and contribute 13 percent of total employment and 8 percent of firm revenues.<br> &nbsp;<br> IN POLITICS<br> &nbsp;<br> More women are entering politics than ever before. The following statistics, however, show there is still a far way to go to reach parity with male political leaders. <br> &nbsp;<br> Globally:<br> &nbsp;<br> �There are thirty-two female leaders in countries or self-ruling territories.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the United States, women hold:<br> &nbsp;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 percent of seats in the U.S. Senate;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17.9 percent of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23.4 percent of state-level elective offices.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> As women realize their economic power and start leveraging it, these statistics will continue to improve. In addressing this global shift at the World Economic Forum, the International Monetary Fund&#x2019;s managing director, Christine Lagarde, talked about the power of what she termed &#x201c;inclusive growth.&#x201d; She stated, &#x201c;The evidence is clear, as is the message: when women do better, economies do better.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> While I look at these statistics and applaud the progress women have made, and are making, I realize that there are many other women who still react to them with anger. Is there still progress to be made? Of course there is! Certainly, the fact that the glass ceiling is still holding down the number of women in the top executive positions and corporate boardrooms, as well as the fact that there is still a formidable pay gap between men and women, both continue to challenge women striving to excel in the corporate world. <br> &nbsp;<br> But instead of focusing on the negatives, let&#x2019;s acknowledge the positive accomplishments of women leaders in business, both as corporate leaders and entrepreneurs, in politics and education today, and let&#x2019;s celebrate these women. Celebrate them for their courage, their success, and their leadership. Then let&#x2019;s come together as women to provide mentoring to younger women and tell them that they can be anyone, or do anything they want, as long as they work hard and focus on their goals. Women must help other women to succeed. <br> &nbsp;<br> Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg triggered a media blitz when she called for women to &#x201c;lean in&#x201d; and pursue their careers aggressively. In her book, <i>Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead</i>, released in 2013, she encouraged women to adopt traditionally &#x201c;male&#x201d; characteristics like working long hours, taking credit for performance, and being outspoken. <br> &nbsp;<br> Many of her critics pushed back, saying she was an elitist and out of touch with middle-class working women who cannot afford expensive nannies, while others criticized her for focusing on internal issues that women face, rather than the external issues of equal pay and opportunity and condemning current male-dominated corporate executive suites and boardrooms for not inviting more women to join their ranks.<br> &nbsp;<br> Both positions have valid issues; instead of criticizing each other, it is time to join forces for the betterment of all women.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some of Sheryl&#x2019;s comments about the women, their struggles, and how to overcome them rang very true for me and I would like to share them: <br> &nbsp;<br> Throughout my life, I was told over and over about inequalities in the workplace and how hard it would be to have a career and a family. I rarely heard anything about the ways I might hold myself back. <br> &nbsp;<br> Don&#x2019;t put on the brakes. Accelerate. Keep your foot on the gas pedal. When more people [women] get in the race, more records will be broken. More female leadership will lead to fairer treatment for <i>all </i>women. <br> &nbsp;<br> As I read her book, I saw Sheryl sharing her own successful career path as a woman, and the decisions that she made along the way, in the hope that it would provide inspiration to other women. One of her strongest messages is that women are taught that they need to limit their drive for power, which in turn limits their own ambitions and as a result often sabotages their careers. <br> &nbsp;<br> I believe many, if not most, women do face self-confidence issues. While one woman may not be able to change the law regarding equal pay and opportunity, every woman can change her own internal dialogue about her ability to be successful. <i>Think and Grow Rich for Women </i>focuses on how women today can shed the chains of old thinking and old paradigms, and confidently create a life of success and significance. <br> &nbsp;<br> I would highlight the fact that what helped successful women succeed in the past may not be the right advice for women seeking success in the future. While I agree that women need to face their own internal struggles, often about work/life balance, I believe that rather than telling women to be more like men, we should highlight the benefits found in female leadership that may be better suited for today&#x2019;s business environment. <br> &nbsp;<br> As women have increased their numbers and influence in the workforce over the last decade, the business world as a whole has also been changing. We have moved from the Industrial Age into the Information Age, and there has been a spiritual change in the way business is done. The Industrial Age was one where competition was king.

Stories always go on. They don&#39;t end on the last page, any more than they begin on the first page.&#34; A fitting meta-observation for this, the unplanned second installment in Cornelia Funke&#39;s beloved now-trilogy. Of course, it&#39;s that sort of earnest, almost gushing veneration of books and book-loving that made the absorbing suspense-fantasy Inkheart so wonderful in the first place, with that lit-affection getting woven integrally into the plot (Inkheart being both Funke&#39;s first book in the series, and the fictitious book within that book, authored by the frustrated Fenoglio, now trapped within the book, er, within the book. Fenoglio, perhaps not surprisingly, self-referentially wishes in Inkspell that he had written a sequel to Inkheart.) Inkspell should serve as a special treat for fans of the first book, as characters from Inkheart who have found themselves in the &#34;real world&#34; (if there is such a thing) find themselves read back into their own mythic, word-spun world--along with some of our favorite &#34;real-world&#34; characters. As with the previous book, Funke&#39;s greatest accomplishment here is telling such a rich and involving (and fun!) story, while still managing sweet, subtle commentary on the nature of words and meaning. Expect a tantalizing finale, too--as Funke says, &#34;No reader will forgive me the ending, though, without a part three.&#34; (Ages 8 and up) --Paul Hughes</p><p></p><h2>The Presidents and UFOs: A Secret History from FDR to Obama</h2><p><p>The UFO enigma has been part of our culture since the 1940s and building to a worldwide explosion of acceptance today. Now, as governments around the world open their files and records on internal UFO investigations, the US remains steadfast in its denial of interest in the UFO issue. As more of the world's population accepts the possibility of an extraterrestrial presence, the demand is building for disclosure from the United States.</p><p>Using newly declassified and Freedom of Information Act documents, eyewitness accounts, interviews, and leaked documents being authenticated, THE PRESIDENTS AND UFOS details the secret history of UFOs and the corresponding presidential administration. Starting in 1941 with the Roosevelt administration, author Larry Holcombe examines the startling discoveries facing a president preoccupied by WWII, the explosion of UFO sightings during the Truman years, first contact during the Eisenhower administration, and the possibility of a UFO connection to the Kennedy assassination. In 1975, the Nixon administration came very close to admitting that UFOs exist by funding a documentary by Robert Emenegger. Almost 40 years later, this book will examine Emenegger's findings.</p><p>For the first time, the involvement of all of the modern presidents up to and including President Obama, and the rise and then fall of their influence on UFO issues, are told in one story that is an integral part of the fascinating UFO tapestry.</p></p><p><p>LARRY HOLCOMBE's introduction to the world of ufology came in the late 1950's after reading Major Donald Keyhoe's, <i>Flying Saucers Are Real </i>and <i>Flying Saucers from Outer Space</i>. These books started a 50 plus year study and avocation into mainstream research on the subject. His writing, speaking efforts and interviews now center on bringing light to bear on the continued United States denial and cover-up of UFO issues. He lives in Callao, Virginia.</p><p>&#x201c;Holcomb's inclusion of official documents lends his topic an elusive validation, adding weight to his story. There's a cinematic undercurrent that runs through the book.... he raises many questions and offers plenty of evidence to keep fellow ufologists debating the topic for years to come.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;A thoroughly researched and well documented synopsis of the UFO phenomena. Highly recommended for those who want to educate themselves about the UFO mystery that continues to baffle observers throughout the world.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Stan Gordon, UFO Researcher and Author</i></p><p>&#x201c;Eminently readable and meticulously researched, this fascinating new book documents the evolution of the US government's handling of the UFO phenomenon, with the story neatly woven together by exploring the intriguing question of what various Presidents knew (or didn't know) about the issue.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Nick Pope, UK Ministry of Defense UFO Project, 1991-1994 and author of Encounter in Rendlesham Forest</i></p></p><h2>The Language of Doors</h2><p>A home's facade speaks volumes. In fact, the changing facades of the American home mirror the changes of our nation&#x2014;from puritanical Colonial to wealthy Georgian; from the pioneering spirit of the western Prairie style to the industrially inspired Modern. Who would think a front door would have so much to say? But not only does a front entranceway convey a moment in the history of architectural design, it also serves as the most dramatic and affordable means to make your home reflect your personal taste. <br><br> You've seen many of these entrances before, but perhaps withut knowing their architectural style, the period they represent, or their place in American history. You probably prefer some more than others, but perhaps without knowing exactly why. And you may have een tried visualizing some of the entrances on your own home...<br><br> With 120 drawings by architect Paulo Vicente and accompanying text by home design expert Tom Connor, <i>The Language of Doors</i> identifies and discusses 350 years of architectural styles. It then applies these various styles to entranceways of differing homes so you can imagine the impact a new entrance might have on your <i>own</i> home. <br><br> With its easy-to-read labels and informative glossary, <i>The Language of Doors</i> is at once a mini history of American home design and a dictionary of architectural elements. You don't have to be a home owner to want to know the difference between a flute and a dentil, a keystone and a pilaster. But if you are a homeowner with an interest in upgrading the look of your home, <i>The Language of Doors</i> is the perfect book to spark your creative thinking and just possibly save you thousands of dollars in architect's and builder's fees.</p><p>A veritable field guide to entranceways for home owners looking to add &#x201c;curb appeal,&#x201d; extra value, and character to their home and for anyone interested in decorative architectural elements and their history. <br> <br>As the eyes are windows to the soul, the front door is to the soul of the home, and it is not by accident that some homes say welcome, whereas others don&#x2019;t. Architects have long known that a great entranceway is the most dramatic and affordable way to transform a home and to make it a true expression of oneself. But how to visualize the wealth of possibilities? In The Language of Doors, a celebrated architect and a home design expert provide nearly 100 entrance styles that run the gamut from English Colonial to Art Deco. Then they demonstrate how these entrances would look superimposed on different home styles. Along the way readers get a mini history of architectural styles and 120 illustrations that identify all the decorative architectural elements we&#x2019;ve always wanted to know the words for, but didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;until now.<b>A Mini History of American Home Design and Illustrated Guide to Architectural Elements</b><br><br> Includes: A wealth of ideas for home owners interested in adapting handsome, classic doorways in order to give their homes character, value, and curb appeal.<br><br> A captivating history of 350 years of architectural style and innovation<br><br> Plus all the words you need to know to speak with designers, architects, and contractors</p><h2>Kneeknock Rise</h2><p><p>From the moment young Egan arrives in Instep for the annual fair, he is entranced by the fable surrounding the misty peak of�&nbsp;Kneeknock Rise: On stormy nights when the rain drives harsh and�&nbsp;cold, an undiscovered creature raises its voice and moans.

E. MODESITT, JR. is the bestselling author of more than seventy novels encompassing two science fiction series, the Ghost Books and the Ecolitan Matter, and four fantasy series, the Imager Portfolio, the Saga of Recluce, the Spellsong Cycle and the Corean Chronicles. He lives in Cedar City, Utah.1 <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d think the Tilborans would have more sense,&#x201d; snapped Bhayar. &#x201c;Some of them, anyway.&#x201d; His dark blue eyes appeared almost black in the dim light of the small study that adjoined his receiving chamber. In the midafternoon of summer, the air barely moved, even with the high arched ceilings, and when it did, it only brought the smells of the city up the hill to the palace overlooking the harbor of Solis. He walked to the map displayed on the wooden stand, scowled, and then looked to the man in scholar&#x2019;s brown. <br>&#x201c;Why would you think that?&#x201d; Quaeryt replied in the formal Bovarian in which he&#x2019;d been addressed, as always. He smiled politely, his thin lips quirking up slightly at the corners. Despite the itching of his slightly-too-long nose, he did not scratch it. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bait me, scholar.&#x201d; The Lord of Telaryn added only a slight emphasis to the last word. &#x201c;Tell me what you have in mind.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Only your best interests, my lord.&#x201d; Quaeryt shifted his weight off his slightly shorter left leg. The higher heel of his left boot helped, but the leg ached when he stood for long periods. <br>&#x201c;When you talk like that, you remind me of the sycophants who surrounded my sire in his last days.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why might they have talked like that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Answer my question!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Have you considered why I&#x2014;or they&#x2014;would avoid answering a demand delivered so forcefully?&#x201d; Quaeryt grinned. <br>Abruptly, Bhayar laughed. &#x201c;There are times&nbsp;&#x2026; friend or no friend&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Every time anything went wrong in Tilbor immediately after your sire conquered it, his first solution was to issue an edict. If that didn&#x2019;t work, he killed people.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It worked, didn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It did indeed. It still does. But&nbsp;&#x2026; exactly how many of your soldiers are stationed in Tilbor and not on the borders with Bovaria? How many weeks would it take to get the companies from Tilbora or Noira to Solis&#x2014;if you had enough ships to carry them?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I could commandeer merchantmen.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How long before they became as unhappy with you as the Tilborans are?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They won&#x2019;t turn to Kharst.&#x201d; Bhayar laughed. <br>&#x201c;Not until they forget what he did to the Pharsi merchants in Eshtora. How long will that be? As long as you&#x2019;ve had garrisons in Tilbor?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Quaeryt! Enough of your questions. You&#x2019;re as bad as Uhlyn was. Scholars and imagers! A ruler can&#x2019;t live with them, and a strong one can&#x2019;t live without them. You&#x2019;ll turn my hair as white as yours.&#x201d; A fist outsized for the lord&#x2019;s wiry frame slammed onto the pale goldenwood of the desk. <br>That was always Bhayar&#x2019;s rejoinder when he tired of dealing with the issues behind the questions, Quaeryt mused behind a pleasant smile, and never mind the fact that Quaeryt&#x2019;s hair was white blond and that he was actually a year younger than Bhayar, who had just turned thirty. <br>&#x201c;Namer&#x2019;s demons, I hate Solis in the summer. I&#x2019;d even prefer the mist stench of Extela when the winds blow off the mountain.&#x201d; <br> <i>Mist stench?</i> Abruptly, Quaeryt recalled that some of the ancient volcanoes north of the old capital occasionally still belched ash and fumes. <br>Bhayar blotted his forehead with a linen cloth already soiled in more places than not, for all that it had been fresh and white at noon. &#x201c;Instead of raising all these questions, why don&#x2019;t you offer an answer?&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt grinned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t recall your asking for one.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m asking now. What do you suggest, my friend, the so-knowledgeable scholar? Tell me what I can do to remove the troops from Tilbor without immediately inviting another rebellion?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Let me think about it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think too long.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;After breakfast&#x2014;eighth glass of the morning,&#x201d; suggested Quaeryt, knowing that was too late for the early-rising lord. <br>&#x201c;Seventh glass. I still don&#x2019;t see why you don&#x2019;t want to stay in the palace. I&#x2019;ve offered far better quarters than you have on Scholarium Hill&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The quarters are indeed better, but I&#x2019;d end up being of no help to you.&#x201d; <i>Or to me.</i> &#x201c;And rulers soon tire of friends or retainers who outlive their usefulness.&#x201d; That was accurate, but not the real reason for his determination to avoid the palace for as long as possible. &#x201c;Besides, you&#x2019;d want me to get up at the Namer-fired glass that you do.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not that lazy. You just like me to think you are.&#x201d; <br> <i>You and everyone else.</i> &#x201c;But I am. I don&#x2019;t work the way you do. I&#x2019;m just an itinerant scholar fortunate enough to have schooled some with the Lord of Telaryn.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Bah&nbsp;&#x2026; we&#x2019;ll let everyone else think that.&#x2026;&#x201d; Bhayar blotted his forehead again. &#x201c;Why did he insist on moving the capitol here?&#x201d; Before Quaeryt could have answered, not that he had any intention of doing so, the lord went on, &#x201c;I know. I know. A port city on a big river and a good harbor makes more sense for trade and for moving armies. And Grandmere&#x2026;&#x201d; He shook his head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have to like it.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt wondered about what Bhayar might have said about his grandmother, but decided not to ask. He&#x2019;d pressed enough. &#x201c;Tomorrow at seventh glass, then, sire?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Go!&#x201d; Bhayar shook his head, but then grinned again. <br>&#x201c;I hear and obey.&#x201d; Quaeryt&#x2019;s words were light, verging on the sardonic. <br>As he left the study and entered the private corridor separating the receiving hall from the study, Quaeryt forced himself to walk without limping, uncomfortable as it was, but he tried never to limp in the palace or when he was around Bhayar. He glanced into the large chamber, on the third level, the highest one in the palace, where, when necessary, Bhayar sat on the gilded throne that had been brought from Extela by his sire sixteen years before and received visitors or handed down formal pronouncements or sentences. Even the wide windows didn&#x2019;t help much in keeping the chamber cool in the height of summer. <br>Quaeryt made his way to the west end of the private corridor, where the palace guard unlocked the iron-grille door, allowing the scholar to make his way down the windowless and stifling staircase, past the grille door on the second level to the main-level grille door. Another guard unlocked that door as well. Quaeryt stepped carefully along the shaded and colonnaded walk that bordered the west end of the palace gardens, taking his time so that he could enjoy the cooler air created by the fountains. His enjoyment was always tempered by the knowledge that oxen&#x2014;and sometimes prisoners&#x2014;turned the capstan-like pumps that lifted the water to the reservoirs on the uppermost level at the rear of the palace. He was careful not to look into the gardens. After passing the guard at the top of the side steps, he walked down to the gate used by favored vendors and visitors to the palace. <br>&#x201c;Good day, scholar,&#x201d; offered the taller soldier of the two at the gate in accented Bovarian. <br>&#x201c;The same to you. I don&#x2019;t envy you in this heat.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Some of the mist from the gardens drifts down here. It&#x2019;s better than the main gate, let me tell you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can imagine.&#x201d; Quaeryt smiled and stepped out onto the wide stone sidewalk below the wall, a sidewalk that bordered the north side of the stone-paved avenue. <br>Across the avenue to the south and below the palace were the public gardens, open to those suitably attired, according to the judgment of the palace guards stationed at the two entrances. There weren&#x2019;t that many fountains there, and the cooler venues would already be taken. He turned right and started back toward the hill to the west, close to a vingt away, that held the Scholarium Solum&nbsp;&#x2026; and the Scholars&#x2019; House. <br>The one-legged beggar boy was a good two blocks west of the palace grounds. Beggars weren&#x2019;t allowed any closer. <br>Quaeryt flipped a copper to the beggar boy. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s from Lord Bhayar.&#x201d; His words were in common Tellan. <br>The beggar frowned. <br>The scholar flipped a second copper. &#x201c;And that&#x2019;s from me, but you wouldn&#x2019;t have either without your lord.&#x201d; <br>The beggar looked at the coppers. &#x201c;Could you a gotten &#x2019;em any dirtier, lord scholar?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Complaints, yet? Next time I might try.&#x201d; Privately, Quaeryt was pleased. It was easier to image a shiny copper than a worn and grubby one, not that anyone would have cared about coppers, but coppers added up to silvers, and silvers to golds, and few would think that a scholar who had dirty coppers was actually imaging them. <br>The scholar studied the avenue ahead of him, taking in the pair of youthful cutpurses, seemingly playing at bones, on the far side of the flower vendor, and the drunken lout who lurched out of the tavern. His appearance was timed too well and he was just a tad too tipsy. Quaeryt imaged a patch of fish oil onto the heels and soles of his polished boots, just before the fellow reached him. <br>The man&#x2019;s heels slipped from under him, and the slam-thief flailed before hitting the stones of the sidewalk. &#x201c;Friggin&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x2026; sow-slut&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>Obviously, the would-be grabber was having a slow day. Otherwise, he wouldn&#x2019;t even have bothered with a scholar&nbsp;&#x2026; unless he knew who Quaeryt was. That could be a problem. <br>&#x201c;Do you need help?&#x201d; Quaeryt asked, expecting the usual knife. <br>As the man tried to scramble to his feet and the knife appeared, Quaeryt imaged out a sliver of steel, and the useless blade separated from the hilt, and haft and blade clunked on the stones&#x2014;just as the thief&#x2019;s boots slid out from under him again and he crashed face-first onto the sidewalk. He moaned, but didn&#x2019;t move for a moment, and Quaeryt skirted his prone figure, stepping into the avenue and barely avoiding a carriage before regaining the sidewalk. He&#x2019;d gotten a good look. He just hoped he didn&#x2019;t have to deal with the thief again. That was one problem with using imaging to create accidents. Some people didn&#x2019;t learn. They just blamed their bad luck and went on doing stupid or dangerous things. <br>Although Quaeryt walked at a good pace, he didn&#x2019;t strain, and he was only sweating moderately when he reached the point where the avenue passed in front of the hill on which the so-called Scholarium Solum was set. The Scholars&#x2019; House was halfway down the hill on the west side. Quaeryt glanced up the hill to the dark red brick building that held the Scholarium Solum as he walked past it to the winding walk up to the Scholars&#x2019; House, no longer bothering to hide the slight limp he&#x2019;d always had. <br>The brick steps of the front entry had shifted slightly over time, and Quaeryt had to take care as he climbed them onto the front porch because his bad leg had a tendency to drag. The wide-roofed porches that encircled the Scholars&#x2019; House were designed to pick up the sea breezes, but since the sea breezes brought red flies in the day and mosquitoes at twilight, not to mention all the less than savory smells of the harbor, few scholars ventured out onto the porches once the sun dropped behind the warehouses and factorages to the west. <br>Quaeryt made his way to the east porch, the most shaded one in the afternoon. <br>There a younger man in a grayish purple shirt and trousers looked up from his wooden straight-backed chair. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a hot walk from the palace. I still don&#x2019;t see why Lord Bhayar doesn&#x2019;t offer you quarters.&#x201d; Voltyr spoke in Bovarian, as did all scholars, at least with each other and in dealing with the palace and other high officials. He was several years younger than Quaeryt, how many Quaeryt didn&#x2019;t know exactly. He&#x2019;d never asked. <br>&#x201c;Would you want to live in the palace, Voltyr?&#x201d; asked Quaeryt as he settled into the chair across from the younger man. <br>&#x201c;No. You know that. You&#x2019;re a scholar. Scholars&#x2019; Houses are the only place for imagers, and they&#x2019;re not even half-safe in some cities, even here at times. Do you know what it was like when my parents discovered I could image a copper?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I imagine they were upset and pleased all at once.&#x201d; Quaeryt had heard enough that when he&#x2019;d done his first imaging&#x2014;after hearing about imagers from old Scholar Geis, he&#x2019;d tried to image a cake, and it had tasted like mud&#x2014;he&#x2019;d done it alone. But then, all his imaging had been in secret and painfully discovered by trial and error when the scholars who raised him were not around. <br>&#x201c;They were just upset. In a month, I was here, being told not to image until I was older&nbsp;&#x2026; but no one could help me. They just told me to be careful.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;There aren&#x2019;t that many imagers. What about Uhlyn?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The only thing he ever said was not to image large things and not to try imaging anything out of metal until I had a beard and then to begin with small items.&#x201d; Voltyr laughed harshly. &#x201c;He was so careful about his imaging, but look what happened to him, even with Bhayar&#x2019;s protection.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t careful about other things. He flaunted being an imager.&#x201d; Even as Quaeryt spoke, he understood how many people feared imagers and their seemingly wondrous ability to visualize something and then have it appear. What so few wanted to understand was how painfully few imagers there were or how much skill and strength and concentration it took to image the smallest of objects, and how most imagers could do little beyond that. But&nbsp;&#x2026; those who could&nbsp;&#x2026; they were feared and shunned, and often the target of anyone who knew their abilities. <br>&#x201c;Oh&nbsp;&#x2026; and it&#x2019;s all right for merchants and High Holders to flaunt what they are, but not imagers? Even scholars can flaunt their knowledge.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not without risk,&#x201d; returned Quaeryt. &#x201c;People don&#x2019;t like to be reminded of what they don&#x2019;t know. That&#x2019;s why Scholars&#x2019; Houses are also the safest place for scholars. Good scholars ask questions. Questions upset rulers and those who fawn on them.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Scholars in favor can gather in golds,&#x201d; pointed out Voltyr. <br>&#x201c;Golds aren&#x2019;t much use to a headless man.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ask questions.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the point of being a scholar, then?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How about the good life&nbsp;&#x2026; or the best life possible for someone who wasn&#x2019;t born a High Holder?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;High Holders are captive to their wealth.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Quaeryt&nbsp;&#x2026; I&#x2019;d like to be held captive like that.&#x201d; <br>The scholar laughed, then sat there for several moments before asking, &#x201c;What do you know about Tilbor?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Most of it is cold. The people are rude and crude, and they don&#x2019;t like strangers. They don&#x2019;t like scholars and imagers, except that they like Telaryn soldiers even less. They like to fight a lot, except when they&#x2019;re drinking, and they do a lot of that in the winter because it&#x2019;s too cold to do anything else. Even Antiagon Fire wouldn&#x2019;t warm Noira in midwinter.&#x201d; The imager frowned. &#x201c;Why are you asking?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking of going there.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why, for the sake of the Nameless?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;To learn about it, to try to resolve something for Lord Bhayar. Besides, I&#x2019;ve been seen at the palace too much in the past few seasons. That&#x2019;s getting to be a problem.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a problem half the High Holders in Telaryn would like to have.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They only think they want that problem. They don&#x2019;t know Bhayar.&#x201d; <br>Voltyr frowned. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not that arbitrary or cruel. Certainly not like his father, is he?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s generally very fair. Most High Holders aren&#x2019;t. But neither forgets <i>anything</i>.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt stood. &#x201c;Do you want to go down to Amphora later? I have a few spare coppers.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How could I refuse such an invitation?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; laughed the scholar. &#x201c;Half past fifth glass? I have work to do later.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re paying.&#x201d; <br>With a last smile, Quaeryt turned and walked toward the north porch, hoping the nook by the north chimney wall would be vacant. Both Bhayar&#x2019;s and Voltyr&#x2019;s comments about imagers had played into the half-formed idea in his thoughts. Why, indeed, did imagers have to move and act with such care? Could he do anything about that? Or, at least, about his own position? <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2011 by L. E.

The painted lady people add two more volumes to their previously published Painted Ladies (Dutton, 1978) and Daughters of Painted Ladies ( LJ 11/15/87). As in their first volume, in Painted Ladies Revisited San Francisco is the point of reference for a further exploration of the colorist movement and its relationship to domestic, and especially Victorian, architecture. Fabulous interior and exterior shots give the reader a glimpse of the city's mix of modern, traditional, and Victorian and how they harmonize. Richly illustrated in full color, and enhanced by clear annotations, Painted Ladies Revisited is a natural for architectural and design collections and for public libraries that are budgeted to collect widely in this area. It is How To Create Your Own Painted Lady , however, that deserves the extra attention here. As the subtitle indicates, this book includes information on paint selection, techniques for special effects (faux marbling, for example), equipment, interior and exterior painting, and more. Color photos and drawings illustrate the painting techniques and color plans for exteriors, and designers are given the opportunity to demonstrate and explain their own particular ideas and color and design preferences. Public libraries, particularly those situated in areas with much vintage architecture, will want this fine addition to their how-to collection.<br><i>- Carol Spielman Lezak, General Learning Corp., Northbrook, Ill.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.This new volume in Pomada and Larsen's popular series on Victorian restoration in San Francisco surveys recent additions to that city's trove of ebullient renovated gingerbread. From an original stock of almost 50,000, 13,437 residential Victorians are still standing; much as 19th-century California gold built them, yuppies began financing their rebirth in the mid-'70s. Asserting that those early projects, typified by a whimsical use of bright, contrasting colors, are giving way to a "more subtle, sophisticated" style, the book unveils interiors and exteriors of many splendid high-ceilinged, bay-windowed specimens often furnished as lushly as old-time bordellos. Though accompanying text is repetitious, and may state the obvious ("a Victorian profusion of possessions and decoration can be found"), Keister's photographs are irresistible, evoking a dignified fantasy in architecture given a gleefully childish air by San Franciscans. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Celebrity Homes II: Architectural Digest presents the private worlds of thirty international personalities</h2><p>A large book with pictures and information regarding 30 high profile personalities and how they live.</p><p></p><h2>French English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)</h2><p>Newly revised and updated, the <i>French-English Bilingual Visual Dictionary</i> is a quick and intuitive way to learn and recall everyday words in French. <p>The <i>French-English Bilingual Visual Dictionary</i> introduces a range of useful current vocabulary in thematic order, using full-color photographs and artworks to display and label all the elements of everyday life &#x2014; from the home and office to sport, music, nature, and the countries of the world &#x2014; with panel features on key nouns, verbs, and useful phrases.</p> <p>The <i>French-English Bilingual Visual Dictionary</i> features:</p> <ul> <li>A quick and intuitive way to learn and remember thousands of words.</li> <li>A complete range of illustrated objects and scenes from everyday life.</li> <li>Fast and effective learning for any situation, from home and office to shopping and dining out.</li> <li>Detailed index for instant reference.</li> <li>Handy size ideal for travel.</li> </ul> <p>The illustrations in the <i>French-English Bilingual Visual Dictionary</i> provide a quick and intuitive route to learning a language, defining the words visually so it is easier to remember them and creating a colorful and stimulating learning resource for the foreign-language and EFL/ESL student.</p></p><p>DK was founded in London in 1974 and is now the world's leading illustrated reference publisher and part of Penguin Random House, formed on July 1, 2013.

Shirer sifted through the massive self-documentation of the Third Reich, to create a monumental study that has been widely acclaimed as the definitive record of one of the most frightening chapters in the history of mankind--now in a special 30th anniversary edition.<br>"One of the most important works of history of our time."<br>THE NEW YORK TIMES</p><p>William L. Shirer's THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH is a monumental study of the 20th Century's most frightening moments. Now, 53 years after the end of World War II, it may seem incredible that our most valued institutions, and way of life, were threatened by the menace that Hitler and the Third Reich represented. Shirer's description of events and the cast of characters who played such pivotal roles in defining the course Europe was to take is unforgettable.<br><br>Benefiting from his many years as a reporter, and thus a personal observer of the rise of Nazi Germany, and availing himself of some of the 485 tons of documents from the German Foreign Office, captured by the First Army, as well as countless other diaries, phone transcriptions, and other written records, meticulously kept at every level by the Germans, Shirer has put together a brutally objective account of how Hitler wrested political control of Germany, and planned and executed his 6 year quest to dominate the world, only at the end, to see Germany go down in flames.<br><br>The combination of personal recollection and amassing of historical evidence distinguishes this book as one of the great historical works of any time. For instance, he recounts that, from his apartment in Plosslgasse, in Vienna, he personally witnessed how perhaps half of Vienna's 180,000 Jews bargained their way to freedom in 1938.<br><br>Shirer explains that Hitler believed that France and England were too weak to pose much of a threat to his ambitions to subjugate Czechoslovakia, and later Poland. The momentary relief of Russia as a threat to his domination of Europe as a result of the flurry of diplomatic activity that proceeded his invasion of Poland is fascinating. There is no relief, throughout his narrative, of the brutality of Hitler and such a large contingent of Germans who populate this narrative.<br><br>Although 1600 pages long, this is such a richly rewarding experience for anyone who wants to come to grips with the mysterious question as to how this menace to civilization ever came into being, much less was sustained for as long as it was. The answer, unfortunately, is that most of Germany, for a whole host of reasons, embraced Nazism and the fanaticism that Hitler engendered.<br><br>For another book that deals with this problem, why so much of Germany lent its support to Hitler, I heartily recommend HITLER'S WILLING EXECUTIONER'S, by Daniel Goldhagen, published by Vintage Books. Although filled with perhaps more statistical details then the non-professional historian would need, this book helps to adumbrate the themes in Shirer's great book.<br><br>George Davidson, Director of Production, The Ballantine Publishing Group<b>Ron Rosenbaum </b>is the bestselling author of <i>Explaining Hitler </i>and <i>The Shakespeare Wars </i>and has written or edited six<i> </i>other books.

Coming to England aged 16, she drifted into various jobs before starting to write in Paris in the late 1920&#39;s. QUARTET was first published as &#39;Postures&#39; in 1928. Her novels, often portraying women as underdogsout to exploit their sexualities, were ahead of their time and only modestly successful. From 1939 she lived reclusively, and was largely forgotten when she made a sensational comeback with &#39;Wide Sargasso Sea&#39; in 1966. She died in 1979.If difficulty of subject is to be considered in judging the merit of a novel, Miss Rhys must be accredited with high achievement. Not only does she deal with the most complex personalities, exploring the most intimate recesses of their psychology, but she does so with the directness and certitude of the fine artist. The style, especially of the dialogue, belongs to the new tradition in prose, which shuns elaboration for sharpness and intensity of effect.</p><h2>The Laura Ingalls Wilder Country Cookbook</h2><p>An original collection of recipes by Laura Ingalls Wilder is adapted from her personal records at Rocky Ridge Farm and includes such farmhouse fare as chicken and dumplings, corn pudding, and strawberry pie.</p><p>Grade 5 Up-A recently discovered recipe collection compiled during the author's life with Almanzo at Rocky Ridge Farm in Mansfield, MI. The 73 recipes are good, honest fare from the 1930s and '40s for everyday and special occasions. At least as interesting as the recipes is the glimpse into Wilder's happy and productive adult life as a farmer, friend, and writer. This large format book is full of black-and-white photographs of her family and friends, and full-color photos of Rocky Ridge Farm, inside and out. The farm pictures tend to be posed and repetitious; but for Wilder fans this volume will illuminate a facet of her life that is new for some readers. Barbara Walker's The Little House Cookbook (HarperCollins, 1979) is aimed at a younger audience and is more closely related to the books that made Wilder famous.<br><i>Carolyn Jenks, First Parish Unitarian Church, Portland, ME</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Why Time Flies: A Mostly Scientific Investigation</h2><p><b>&#x201c;[<i>Why Time Flies</i>] captures us.

I feel unmoored. The calendar says late winter but outside my window the day is warm and fair, the leaf buds gleam, the city is resplendent. I arrived from New York yesterday and stayed out past midnight with friends; today my head is still in the dark, glued in a season and a time zone several hours behind me. I glance at my watch: 9:44 a.m. As usual, I am late.<br> <br>The watch is a recent gift from my father-in-law, Jerry, who wore it himself for many years. When Susan and I became engaged, her parents offered to buy me a new watch. I declined, but for a long time afterward I couldn&#x2019;t shake the worry that I&#x2019;d made a poor impression. What sort of son-in-law ignores the time? So when Jerry subsequently offered me his old wristwatch I said yes right away. It has a golden dial set on a wide silver wristband; a black face bearing the brand name (Concord) and the word quartz in bold letters; and the hours denoted by unnumbered lines. I liked the new weight on my wrist, which made me feel important. I thanked him and remarked, more accurately than I could understand at that moment, that it would be a helpful addition to my research on time.<br> <br>On the evidence of my senses, I had come to believe that the time &#x201c;out there&#x201d; in clocks, watches, and train schedules is quantifiably distinct from the time coursing through my cells, body, and mind. But the fact was that I knew as little about the former as I did about the latter. I could not say how a particular clock or watch worked nor how it managed to agree so closely with the other watches and clocks that I occasionally noticed. If there was a real difference between external and internal time&#x2014;as real as the difference between physics and biology&#x2014;I had no idea what it was.<br> <br>So my new, used watch would be a kind of experiment. What better way to plumb my relationship to time than to physically attach it to me for a while? Almost immediately I saw results. For the first few hours of wearing the watch I could think about nothing else. It made my wrist sweat and tugged at my whole arm. Time dragged literally and, because my mind dwelt on the dragging, figuratively. Soon enough I forgot about the watch. But on the evening of the second day I suddenly remembered it again when, while bathing one of our infant sons in the tub, I noticed it on my wrist, underwater.<br> <br>Secretly I hoped that the watch might confer some degree of punctuality. For instance, it seemed to me that if I looked at the watch often enough I might yet arrive on time for my ten o&#x2019;clock appointment in S�vres, just outside Paris, at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures&#x2014;the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. The Bureau is an organization of scientists devoted to perfecting, calibrating, and standardizing the basic units of measurement used around the world. As our economies globalize, it becomes ever more imperative that we all be on precisely the same metrological page: that one kilogram in Stockholm equals exactly one kilogram in Jakarta, that one meter in Bamako equals exactly one meter in Shanghai, that one second in New York equals exactly one second in Paris. The Bureau is the United Nations of units, the world standardizer of standards.<br> <br>The organization was formed in 1875 through the Convention of the Metre, a treaty meant to ensure that the basic units of measurement are uniform and equivalent across national borders. (The first act of the Convention was for the Bureau to hand out rulers: thirty precisely measured bars made of platinum and iridium, which would settle international disagreements over the correct length of a meter.) Seventeen nation members joined the original Bureau; fifty-eight now belong, including all the major industrialized nations. The suite of standard units it oversees has grown to seven: the meter (length), the kilogram (mass), the ampere (electrical current), the kelvin (temperature), the mole (volume), the candela (luminosity), and the second.<br> <br>Among its many duties, the Bureau maintains a single, official worldwide time for all of Earth, called Coordinated Universal Time, or U.T.C. (When U.T.C. was first devised, in 1970, the organizing parties could not agree on whether to use the English acronym, C.U.T., or the French acronym, T.U.C., so they compromised on U.T.C.) Every timepiece in the world, from the hyperaccurate clocks in orbiting global-positioning satellites to the cog-bound wristwatch, is synchronized directly or eventually to U.T.C. Wherever you live or go, whenever you ask what time it is, the answer ultimately is mediated by the timekeepers at the Bureau.<br> <br>&#x201c;Time is what everybody agrees the time is,&#x201d; a time researcher explained to me at one point. To be late, then, is to be late according to the agreed-on time. By definition, the Bureau&#x2019;s time is not merely the most correct time in the world, it is precisely the correct time. This meant, as I glanced at my watch yet again, that I was not merely late: I was as late as I have ever been and as late as it is possible to be. Soon enough I would learn just how far behind the time I truly was.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>A clock does two things: it ticks and it counts the ticks. The clepsydra, or water clock, ticks to the steady drip of water, which, in more advanced devices, drives a set of gears that nudges a pointer along a series of numbers or hash marks, thereby indicating time&#x2019;s passage. The clepsydra was in use at least three thousand years ago, and Roman senators used them to keep their colleagues from talking for too long. (According to Cicero, to &#x201c;seek the clock&#x201d; was to request the floor and to &#x201c;give the clock&#x201d; was to yield it.) Water ticked and added up to time.<br> <br>For most of history, though, in most clocks, what ticked was Earth. As the planet rotates on its axis, the sun crosses the sky and casts a moving shadow; cast on a sundial, the shadow indicates where you are in the day. The pendulum clock, invented in 1656 by Christiaan Huygens, relies on gravity (affected by Earth&#x2019;s rotation) to swing a weight back and forth, which drives a pair of hands around the face of the clock. A tick is simply an oscillation, a steady beat; Earth&#x2019;s turning provided the rhythm.<br> <br>In practice, what ticked was the day, the rotational interval from one sunrise to the next. Everything in between&#x2014;the hours and minutes&#x2014;was contrived, a man-made way to break up the day into manageable units for us to enjoy, employ, and trade. Increasingly our days are governed by seconds. They are the currency of modern life, the pennies of our time: ubiquitous and critical in a pinch (for instance, when you just manage to make a train connection) yet sufficiently marginal to be frittered away or dropped by the handful without thought. For centuries, the second existed only in the abstract. It was a mathematical subdivision, defined by relation: one-sixtieth of a minute, one thirty-six-hundredth of an hour, one eighty-six-thousand-four-hundredth of a day. Seconds pendulums appeared on some German clocks in the fifteenth century. But it wasn&#x2019;t until 1670, when the British clockmaker William Clement added a seconds pendulum, with its familiar tick-tock, to Huygens&#x2019;s pendulum clock, that the second acquired a reliably physical, or at least audible, form.<br> <br>The second fully arrived in the twentieth century, with the rise of the quartz clock. Scientists had found that a crystal of quartz resonates like a tuning fork, vibrating at tens of thousands of times per second when placed in an oscillating electrical field; the exact frequency depends on the size and shape of the crystal. A 1930 paper titled &#x201c;The Crystal Clock&#x201d; noted that this property could drive a clock; its time, derived from an electrical field instead of gravity, would prove reliable in earthquake zones and on moving trains and submarines. Modern quartz clocks and wristwatches typically use a crystal that has been laser-engineered to vibrate at exactly 32,768 (or 215) times per second, or 32,768 Hz. This provided a handy definition of the second: 32,768 vibrations of a quartz crystal.<br> <br>By the nineteen-sixties, when scientists managed to measure an atom of cesium naturally undergoing 9,192,631,770 quantum vibrations per second, the second had been officially redefined to several more decimal places of accuracy. The atomic second was born, and time was upended. The old temporal scheme, known as Universal Time, was top-down: the second was counted as a fraction of the day, which took its shape from Earth&#x2019;s motion in the heavens. Now, instead, the day would be measured from the ground up, as an accumulation of seconds. Philosophers debated whether this new atomic time was as &#x201c;natural&#x201d; as the old time. But there was a bigger problem: the two times don&#x2019;t quite agree. The increasing accuracy of atomic clocks revealed that Earth&#x2019;s rotation is gradually slowing, adding very slightly to the length of each day. Every couple of years this slight difference adds up to a second; since 1972, nearly half a minute&#x2019;s worth of &#x201c;leap seconds&#x201d; have been added to International Atomic Time to bring it into sync with the planet.<br> <br>In the old days, anyone could make his or her own seconds through simple division. Now the seconds are delivered to us by professionals; the official term is &#x201c;dissemination,&#x201d; suggesting an activity akin to gardening or the distribution of propaganda. Around the world, mainly in national timekeeping laboratories, some three hundred and twenty cesium clocks, each the size of a small suitcase, and more than a hundred large, maser-driven devices generate, or &#x201c;realize,&#x201d; highly accurate seconds on a near-continuous basis. (The cesium clocks, in turn, are checked against a frequency standard generated by a device called a cesium fountain&#x2014;a dozen or so exist&#x2014;which uses a laser to toss cesium atoms around in a vacuum.) These realizations are then added up to reveal the time of day. As Tom Parker, a former group leader at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, told me, &#x201c;The second is the thing that ticks; time is the thing that counts the ticks.&#x201d;<br> <br>N.I.S.T. is a federal agency that helps produce the official, civil time for the United States. Experts at its two laboratories, in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and Boulder, Colorado, keep a dozen or more cesium clocks running at any given time. As precise as these clocks are, they disagree with one another on a scale of nanoseconds, so every twelve minutes they are compared to one another tick by tick to see which are running fast and which are running slow and by exactly how much. The data from the clock ensemble is then numerically mashed into what Parker calls &#x201c;a fancy average,&#x201d; and this becomes the basis for the official time.<br> <br>How this time reaches you depends on your timekeeping device and where you happen to be at the moment. The clock in your laptop or computer regularly checks in with other clocks across the Internet and calibrates itself to them; some or all of these clocks eventually pass through a server run by N.I.S.T. or another official clock and are thereby set even more accurately. Every day, N.I.S.T.&#x2019;s many servers register 13 billion pings from computers around the world inquiring about the correct time. If you are in Tokyo, you might be linked to a time server in Tsukuba that is run by the National Metrology Institute of Japan; in Germany, the source is the Physikalisch-Technische Bundensanstalt.<br> <br>Wherever you are, if you&#x2019;re checking the clock on your cell phone, it&#x2019;s probably receiving its time from the Global Positioning System, an array of navigation satellites synchronized to the U.S. Naval Observatory, near Washington, D.C., which realizes its seconds with an ensemble of seventy-odd cesium clocks. Many other clocks&#x2014;wall clocks, desk clocks, wristwatches, travel alarms, car-dashboard clocks&#x2014;contain a tiny radio receiver that, in the United States, is permanently tuned to pick up a signal from N.I.S.T. Radio Station WWVB, in Fort Collins, Colorado, which broadcasts the correct time as a code. (The signal is very low frequency&#x2014;60 Hz&#x2014;and the bandwidth so narrow that a good minute is needed for the complete time code to come through.) These clocks can generate the time on their own, but for the most part they act as middlemen, serving you the time that is disseminated by more refined clocks somewhere higher up in the temporal chain of command.<br> <br>My wristwatch, in contrast, has no radio receiver or any way of talking to satellites; it&#x2019;s all but off the grid. To synchronize with the wider world I need to look at an accurate clock and then turn the stem of my watch and set the time accordingly. To achieve even greater accuracy I could regularly take my watch to a shop and have its mechanism calibrated to a device called a quartz oscillator, which gains its precision from a frequency standard monitored by N.I.S.T. Otherwise, my watch will keep its realizations to itself and will soon fall out of step with everyone else&#x2019;s. I had assumed that putting on a watch meant strapping established time to my wrist. But, in fact, unless I take the measure of the clocks around me, I am still a rogue. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re free-running,&#x201d; Parker said.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>From the late seventeenth century to the early twentieth century, the most accurate clock in the world resided at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England; it was regularly reset by the Astronomer Royal according to the movement of the heavens. This situation was good for the world but quickly became a problem for the Astronomer Royal. Beginning around 1830, he increasingly found himself interrupted from his work by a knock on the door from a townsperson. Pardon me, he was asked. Would you tell me the time?<br> <br>So many people came knocking that eventually the town petitioned the astronomer for a proper time service; in 1836 he assigned his assistant, John Henry Belville, to the task. Every Monday morning, Belville calibrated his timepiece, a pocket chronometer originally made for the duke of Sussex by the esteemed clockmaker John Arnold &amp; Son, to the observatory time. Then he set off for London to visit his clients&#x2014;clockmakers, watch repairers, banks, and private citizens who paid a fee to synchronize their time to his and, by extension, the observatory&#x2019;s. (Belville eventually replaced the chronometer&#x2019;s gold case with a silver one in order to draw less attention in &#x201c;the less desirable quarters of the town.&#x201d;) When Belville died, in 1856, his widow took over; when she retired, in 1892, the service passed to their daughter Ruth, who became known as &#x201c;the Greenwich time lady.&#x201d; Using the same chronometer, which she called &#x201c;Arnold 345,&#x201d; Miss Belville made the same tour, disseminating what by then was known as Greenwich Mean Time, the official time of Britain. The invention of the telegraph, which enabled remote clocks to synchronize with Greenwich time almost immediately and at lower cost, eventually rendered Miss Belville almost but not quite obsolete. When she retired around 1940, in her mideighties, she still served some fifty clients.<br> <br>I had come to Paris to meet with the Greenwich time lady of the modern era, the Miss Belville for all of Earth: Dr. Elisa Felicitas Arias, the director of the B.I.P.M.&#x2019;s Time Department. Arias is slender, with long brown hair and the air of a kindly aristocrat. An astronomer by training, Arias worked for twenty-five years at observatories in Argentina, her native country, the last ten of them with the Naval Observatory; her specialty is astrometry, the correct measuring of distances in outer space.

She was determined to forge a better life for herself, away from the rampant oppression, abuse, and isolation of her Satmar upbringing in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Out of her experience came the incendiary, bestselling memoir <i>Unorthodox, </i>and now, just a few years later, Feldman has embarked on a triumphant journey of self-discovery&#x2014;a journey in which she begins life anew as a single mother, an independent woman, and a religious refugee.<br><br>Taking her cues from favorite childhood books read in secret and the modern classics only recently introduced to her, Feldman explores the United States, from San Francisco to Chicago, New Orleans, and the Southwest. In her travels, and at home, Feldman redefines her sense of identity&#x2014;no longer Orthodox, she comes to terms with her Jewishness by discovering a world of like-minded outcasts and misfits committed to self-acceptance and healing. Inwardly, Feldman has navigated remarkable experiences: raising her son in the &#x201c;real&#x201d; world, finding solace and solitude in a writing career, and searching for love. Culminating in an unforgettable trip across Europe to retrace her grandmother&#x2019;s life during the Holocaust, <i>Exodus </i>is a deeply moving exploration of the mysterious bonds that tie us to family and religion, the bonds we must sometimes break to find our true selves. Feldman proves herself again to be a captivating storyteller, and her singular life has been an inspiration to countless others and for readers everywhere.</p><p>Deborah Feldman was raised in the Satmar Hasidic community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Her first memoir, <i>Unorthodox, </i>was a <i>New York Times </i>bestseller.

Seven years old, skin pale almost to the point of translucence, lips pursed into a sullen pout. She stares gloomily at the silver Mary Janes on her feet, the tips of which catch the last rays of sunlight quickly fading behind the three-story brownstone.</p><p>She has been scrubbed and primped in preparation for Passover, soon to arrive. Her hair hurts where it&#x2019;s been pulled too tight into a bun at the top of her head. She feels each strand stretching from its inflamed follicle, especially at the nape of her neck, where an early-spring breeze raises goose bumps on the exposed skin. Her hands are folded into the lap of her brand-new purple dress, with peonies and violets splashed wildly on the fabric, smocking at the chest, and a sash tied around the waist. There are new white tights stretched over her thin legs.</p><p>This little side street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, usually bustling with black-clad men carrying prayer books, is momentarily silent and empty, its residents indoors making preparations for the evening. The little girl has managed to sneak away in the rush, to sit alone across from the young pear tree the neighbors planted a few years ago after carving out a square of beige dirt in the stretch of lifeless asphalt. Now it f lowers gently, bulbous white blossoms dangling precariously from its boughs.</p><p>I cross the street toward her. No cars come. The silence is magnificent, enormous. She doesn&#x2019;t seem to notice me approaching, nor does she look up when I sit down next to her on the stoop. I look at her face and know instantly, with the pain of a punch to the gut, exactly how long it&#x2019;s been since there was a smile on it.</p><p>I put my arm around her shoulder, ever so gently, as if she might break from the weight, and I whisper into her ear, &#x201c;Everything is going to be fine.&#x201d;</p><p>She turns and looks at me for the first time, her face a mask of distrust.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be just fine. I promise.&#x201d;</p><p>Snap. The hypnotherapist wakes me by clicking her fingers together in a classic stage move.</p><p>&#x201c;You did good,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Go home and try to have sex tonight. Let me know what happens. I have a feeling we&#x2019;ve fixed the problem. Not completely, but enough for now.&#x201d;</p><p>I get out of the chair, feeling dizzy and disoriented. The little girl in the purple dress recedes rapidly from my memory, even as I grasp for her in my wakeful state. What did we talk about? I can&#x2019;t remember. Did she tell us anything? Does the doctor know something about my past now, something that I don&#x2019;t?</p><p>Never mind. The important thing is, did it really work?</p><p>It&#x2019;s been a year since my husband and I crossed the threshold into our new home and our new life, only to discover that our most important purpose as a couple could not be fulfilled: procreation. Repeated attempts and numerous medical opinions have only served to confuse us further; it&#x2019;s as if a wall has been erected inside me. Could this be the miracle cure I&#x2019;ve been waiting for? Will I really be able to go home tonight and finally consummate my marriage?</p><p>------</p><p>I often wonder why I went back to that day, when the hypnotherapist instructed me to find some version of my childhood self to reassure. It&#x2019;s always the child lurking within us that rebels, that sulks, that angrily demands our attention. On that day, however, I was quiet and internal. Everyone around me was caught up in their work, and I was allowed to move about, feeling temporarily forgotten. It was not a moment of great injury.</p><p>But someone had photographed me earlier. I remember posing in the garden, being coaxed and prodded into a portrait of pleasantness. I saw the photo some years later, and in it I was cringing as if afraid. My brow was furrowed and my shoulders were raised in a guarded posture. It seemed as if there was a person on the other side of the camera making a threat.</p><p>The hypnotherapist had asked me to go back as far as I could, and that&#x2019;s where I went, to the moment the f lash went off and I was temporarily blinded, unable to see the person behind the camera, unable to recall that person later. But I could not approach her there, in the garden, while she was being watched, so I waited for that quiet, private moment that I knew would follow, so that I could pass on the information as instructed.</p><p>The exercise was supposed to heal the wound that had been inflicted so long ago, the one that had eaten so deep into my subconscious that it had managed to seep into my muscles themselves, sealing them shut. Which particular injury had caused the damage I did not know, but the therapist had assured me that all I needed to do was find my wounded self and console her, and the rest would take care of itself.</p><p>All these years later, even though I&#x2019;ve left my marriage and my community and am raising my own child far away from Brooklyn, I still go back to that little girl. I have so much more to share with her now.</p><p>I ask her, &#x201c;Did you ever think this is where we&#x2019;d be?&#x201d;</p><p>------</p><p>I&#x2019;d always dreamed of living by the water. I had glimpsed the ocean only a few times during my urban, closeted childhood in the Satmar community in Williamsburg. My days were spent on asphalt, which would swell in the heat of summer and give off an acrid odor. Trucks would rattle over potholes patched with metal plates, their exhaust poisoning the air. The serenity of the ocean seemed remote, when in fact the sea split into brooding gray serpents that snaked around us from all sides.</p><p>I often painted elaborate fairy-tale endings for myself in my mind, inserting myself into grand, ramshackle beach houses, secluded island retreats, houses on stilts with rivers f lowing beneath them. Not once during my daydreams did I place my future self in the tenement apartment I was most likely to end up in. The memory of those delightful visions returned to me in the summer of 2012, as I searched for the first place that would truly be my home and suddenly realized that those dreams weren&#x2019;t so unrealistic anymore.</p><p>Yet proximity to water wasn&#x2019;t on the short list of requirements I presented to my broker, who specialized in the unique corner of rural New England I was scouting, an area where three states converged, yet which seemed to boast very little of each of them in terms of identity. The area was partly occupied by urbanites who kept a place in the country and embraced by the parents who had moved there for the private schools. After a tumultuous three-year period in Manhattan, during which I had struggled to get my divorce and establish a custody agreement, this seemed like a place to do that which needed doing, the raising of a child, the healing of one&#x2019;s wounds.</p><p>The broker, John, picked me up in his old converted Rover; the windows and roof had been removed, and only the supports, wrapped in padded leather fabric, remained. I climbed up into the passenger seat and gripped the roof frame while we jostled along country roads. A field of sunflowers appeared on the right as we drove up a steep hill, only to gaze down an even greater drop on the other side, clear to a river and the verdant mountains beyond. We turned a corner and passed a meadow upon which strange-looking cows were grazing. They had shaggy straight hair, which spilled over their eyes in tufts, and looked almost like sheep in need of a shearing.</p><p>&#x201c;Those are Scottish Highlanders,&#x201d; John informed me. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re the hardiest of all cows; they can plow any field. No territory is too harsh for them. Great for beginners,&#x201d; he joked. &#x201c;You should try raising some up here.&#x201d;</p><p>This then, was the place for me, I thought, a place where the hardiest of species could thrive on the rockiest of foundations, a place for beginners.</p><p>I looked at a few houses; each had some f law or another. Then we drove down a dead-end street near town, to the very last driveway, which swung up and around a grove of evergreens, and there it was: a modestly sized contemporary house on a hill overlooking a large lake. It was one of those moments in life when you just know. I went through the motions; the broker insisted it wasn&#x2019;t a sure thing, but I knew it was.</p><p>The most powerful thing about living on the water, I would soon learn, is that one is forced into a perpetual relationship with a mirror&#x2014;a reflective surface in some way quite literal and in many other ways deeply spiritual. Contemplating water somehow has the effect of forcing one to contemplate oneself. A good thing, if one&#x2019;s self needs fixing.</p><p>We moved in over the summer. It was a glorious time. Isaac, then six years old, swam in the lake every day. We lay on the dock and peered over the edge to see the sunfish and perch sheltering beneath. He collected snail shells, he tried to skip rocks but rarely succeeded, he spied on rabbits making short work of leafy plants. Every evening the sun would set in magnificent colors over the water, the lake would seem stiller somehow, and the world would get very quiet. I watched, pretzel-legged on the grass, as the last of the pink glow faded, and the crickets assumed their nightly routine. The madness of Manhattan seemed very far away.</p><p>This sense of quiet in my life was very new and, as yet, out of character. My friend Heather used to remark, back when we attended Sarah Lawrence together, that I drove like a bat out of hell. It wasn&#x2019;t that my aggressive maneuvering around New York traffic bothered her; it was just her way of describing, rather endearingly, my general approach to life after a reckless escape from an arranged marriage in a sheltered community. I was constantly shooting off in every direction, arriving at every destination as if I had a trail of cartoon dust clouds behind me.</p><p>I thought a lot about that expression, &#x201c;bat out of hell,&#x201d; in the early days after making the big move to the country. Growing up we had a similar saying in Yiddish that essentially translates to &#x201c;a cow out of the stall.&#x201d; It was used to describe a Hasidic Jew who had left the community, likening the person&#x2019;s behavior to that of a cow suddenly let loose after a lifetime of imprisonment. It was believed that such cows were most likely to charge madcap down a hill to their deaths. Hasidic rebels reportedly indulged in wild, drug-abusing lifestyles that inevitably ended in ruin, similar to the cow&#x2019;s doomed trajectory. Freedom posed an especial danger, the adage emphasized, to those who had never previously experienced it.</p><p>This saying, scornfully evoked when the conversation turned to the subject of the few known rebels in our society, irritated me greatly as a child. Didn&#x2019;t the phrase do more to point out the failings of life in a stall than the dangers of freedom? Wasn&#x2019;t it clear that the cow would have been better off grazing freely in the first place?</p><p>Never mind. If I were a cow out of a stall, then I would be a Scottish Highlander, capable of making it even in the most dangerous terrain, I told myself. There would be no fatal fall for me, no catapulting off a cliff.</p><p>I will admit that people like me do go a little overboard immediately after leaving. We do it for many reasons. For one, we don&#x2019;t know any better. It&#x2019;s like we never learned how to move around at all, having been stuck in one place for so long that we can&#x2019;t get our sea legs. We can&#x2019;t quite master a steady gait. Another reason: You know after World War II, when the concentration camps were liberated, how some people gorged on food and died from shock? Deprivation can make you crazy, desperate. I walked around with that post-deprivation feeling for a long time, gorging inappropriately on every experience with the underlying fear that it would be snatched from me before I could get my fill. But the truth is, even without those reasons, we still run from our stalls as fast as we can, just because we can. Because the feeling of being free is so incredible, so intoxicating, we don&#x2019;t want to meander our way through it. We want to race down that mountain, wind whipping past our ears, whooping loudly in triumph.</p><p>Leaving, to me, felt like climbing a tremendous hill, one of those steep inclines that becomes almost treacherous in that the more momentum you build while racing down it, the more difficult it becomes to stop safely. If you&#x2019;ve ever biked up a hill only to zip freakishly fast down the other side of it, which I did for the first time the summer my son and I moved to the country, you&#x2019;ll understand what I mean. The wonderful thing about it is the natural leveling of the ground that occurs at the bottom. And eventually, we all do hit bottom, and not in the way of the clich�, which I&#x2019;ve always disliked. (The bottom is a good thing. Who decided otherwise?)</p><p>When you hit bottom, and your bicycle tires spin more slowly, or your awkward, close-together steps become longer and looser, you&#x2019;ve hit your stride. You&#x2019;ve found your gait. And everything is A-OK. You get a silly smile on your face at the memory of how you felt f lying down the hill, and you think, man, I am awesome for doing that.</p><p>------</p><p>Let me be clear: my life, right now, is amazing. I have everything I ever dreamed of, and I never forget just how lucky I am to have achieved it. But my feelings have been failing to catch on to the changes in my life; in some ways my brain is still stuck in the past. When I finally went to a psychiatrist to receive a formal diagnosis on the list of mental illnesses I was so sure I suffered from, the verdict of post-traumatic stress disorder seemed almost anticlimactic.</p><p>It might not even be that, the psychiatrist said, recommending talk therapy and nothing else. It could just be an adjustment disorder. Those things go away in six months, he said.</p><p>And yet, I was having bad dreams every night, waking up each morning enveloped by feelings of dread, and I panicked secretly when in groups or crowds. None of this was consistent with the calm and fulfilling existence I had begun living.</p><p>How to describe this feeling? A form of displacement, like being unable to see yourself in a photograph of a scene you remember being part of, or looking at the spot on the map where you know you live but being unable to find the street. Somehow you&#x2019;ve been erased, as if it were all a dream. I had begun, since leaving, to see life as an enormous grid, a cross-section of human connections. Every man and woman appeared as a plotted point on an intricate map, lines drawn between them and close family members, longer lines waiting to rush through open tunnels on the grid to anchor friends, neighbors, lovers, even acquaintances. Wherever I looked, I saw the invisible threads that connected people; every person seemed to have their grid firmly and inextricably in place. And I thought of that saying &#x201c;No man is an island&#x201d; and wondered how long I&#x2019;d survive without a grid of my own, and if it was even possible to rebuild one from scratch.</p><p>Maybe my residual angst is actually predicated on a real experience, not just leftover trauma.

In<i> When I Was a Child I Read Books</i> she returns to and expands upon the themes which have preoccupied her work with renewed vigor.</p><p>In "Austerity as Ideology," she tackles the global debt crisis, and the charged political and social political climate in this country that makes finding a solution to our financial troubles so challenging. In "Open Thy Hand Wide" she searches out the deeply embedded role of generosity in Christian faith.

Some of these things are obvious, since they have been important to me in my career as a student and teacher. But some of them I could never have anticipated. The importance to me of elderly and old American hymns is certainly one example. They can move me so deeply that I have difficulty even speaking about them. The old ballad in the voice of Mary Magdalene, who &#x201c;walked in the garden alone,&#x201d; imagines her &#x201c;tarrying&#x201d; there with the newly risen Jesus, in the light of a dawn which was certainly the most remarkable daybreak since God said, &#x201c;Let there be light.&#x201d; The song acknowledges this with fine understatement: &#x201c;The joy we share as we tarry there / None other has ever known.&#x201d; Who can imagine the joy she would have felt? And how lovely it is that the song tells us the joy of this encounter was Jesus&#x2019;s as well as Mary&#x2019;s. Epochal as the moment is, and inconceivable as Jesus&#x2019;s passage from death to life must be, they meet as friends and rejoice together as friends. This seems to me as good a gloss as any on the text that tells us God so loved the world, this world, our world. And for a long time, until just a decade ago, at most, I disliked this hymn, in part because to this day I have never heard it sung well. Maybe it can&#x2019;t be sung well. The lyrics are uneven, and the tune is bland and grossly sentimental. But I have come to a place in my life where the thought of people moved by the imagination of joyful companionship with Christ is so precious that every fault becomes a virtue. I wish I could hear again every faltering soprano who has ever raised this song to heaven. God bless them all.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is another song I think about&#x2014;&#x201c;I Love to Tell the Story.&#x201d; The words that are striking to me are these: &#x201c;I love to tell the story, for those who know it best / Seem hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest.&#x201d; This is true. Of course those who know it best would be those who, over time, put themselves in the way of hearing it. Nevertheless, if Western history has proved one thing, it is that the narratives of the Bible are essentially inexhaustible. The Bible is terse, the Gospels are brief, and the result is that every moment and detail merits pondering and can always appear in a richer light. The Bible is about human beings, human families&#x2014;in comparison with other ancient literatures the realism of the Bible is utterly remarkable&#x2014;so we can bring our own feelings to bear in the reading of it. In fact, we cannot do otherwise, if we know the old, old story well enough to give it a life in our thoughts.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is something about being human that makes us love and crave grand narratives. Greek and Roman boys memorized Homer. This was a large part of their education, just as memorizing the Koran is now for many boys in Islamic cultures. And this is one means by which important traditions are preserved and made in effect the major dialects of their civilizations. Narrative always implies cause and consequence. It creates paradigmatic structures around which experience can be ordered, and this certainly would account for the craving for it, which might as well be called a need. Homer was taken to have great moral significance, as the Koran surely does, so there is nothing random in the choices civilizations make when literatures are sacred to them. I have a theory that the churches fill on Christmas and Easter because it is on these days that the two most startling moments in the Christian narrative can be heard again. In these two moments, narrative fractures the continuities of history. It becomes so beautiful as to acquire a unique authority, a weight of meaning history cannot approach. The stories really will be told again on these days because a parsing of the text would diminish the richness that, to borrow a phrase from the old Puritan John Robinson, shines forth from the holy Word. And everyone knows the songs, especially at Christmas, and becomes in that hour another teller of the story embedded in them. What child is this? A very profound question. Christmas and Easter are so full of church pageant and family custom that it is entirely possible to forget how the stories told on these two days did indeed rupture history and leave the world changed, implausible as that may seem. At the same time, they have created a profound continuity. If we sometimes feel adrift from humankind, as if our technology-mediated life on this planet has deprived us of the brilliance of the night sky, the smell and companionship of mules and horses, the plain food and physical peril and weariness that made our great-grandparents&#x2019; lives so much more like the life of Jesus than any we can imagine, then we can remind ourselves that these stories have stirred billions of souls over thousands of years, just as they stir our souls, and our children&#x2019;s. What gives them their power? They tell us that there is a great love that has intervened in history, making itself known in terms that are startlingly, and inexhaustibly, palpable to us as human beings. They are tales of love, lovingly enacted once, and afterward cherished and retold&#x2014;by the grace of God, certainly, because they are, after all, the narrative of an obscure life in a minor province. Caesar Augustus was also said to be divine, and there aren&#x2019;t any songs about him.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We here, we Christians, have accepted the stewardship of this remarkable narrative, though it must be said that our very earnest approach to this work has not always served it well. There is a great old American hymn that sounds like astonishment itself, and I mention it here because even its title speaks more powerfully of the meaning of our narrative than whole shelves of books. It is called &#x201c;Wondrous Love.&#x201d; &#x201c;What wondrous love is this that caused the Lord of bliss / to bear the dreadful cross for my soul?&#x201d; If we have entertained the questions we moderns must pose to ourselves about the plausibility of incarnation, if we have sometimes paused to consider the other ancient stories of miraculous birth, this is no great matter. But if we let these things distract us, we have lost the main point of the narrative, which is that God is of a kind to love the world extravagantly, wondrously, and the world is of a kind to be worth, which is not to say worthy of, this pained and rapturous love. This is the essence of the story that forever eludes telling. It lives in the world not as myth or history but as a saturating light, a light so brilliant that it hides its source, to borrow an image from another good old hymn.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we understand this to be true, what response do we make? How do we act? How do we live? We respond by loving the world God loves, presumably. But there is something about human beings that too often makes our love for the world look very much like hatred for it. Jesus said, &#x201c;Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth: I have not come to bring peace, but a sword&#x201d; (Matthew 10:34). He said a number of things: &#x201c;Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you&#x201d; (Matthew 5:44), for example, and &#x201c;Put your sword back in its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword&#x201d; (Matthew 26:52). But for whatever reason&#x2014;as a Calvinist I propose the reason might be our fallen state&#x2014;human beings and Christians have found obedience to the commandment to love one another modified by the statement I quoted first, which does not have the form of a commandment, though it has been taken to have the force of one, and it has inspired the response &#x201c;Send me, Lord,&#x201d; with far more passion and consistency than the commandment tradition says is the last Jesus gave us, that we love one another (John 15:17). As a consequence, Christians have too often loved their enemies to death. Those enemies being, in the majority of cases, other Christians. The Inquisition is the most notorious case in point, but it is by no means isolated. Then as always the rationale was that those people with a different heritage or a different conception of the faith are not <i>real</i> Christians. They should be denounced, converted, or eliminated&#x2014;for the sake of Christianity. And, fortunately, Jesus has provided us with that sword. This is a narrative that has been a major force in Christian history&#x2014;God gives us the means and the obligation to smite his enemies. And we know who they are, so the story goes.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus spoke as a man, in a human voice. And a human voice has a music that gives words their meaning. In that old hymn I mentioned, as in the Gospel, Mary is awakened out of her loneliness by the sound of her own name spoken in a voice &#x201c;so sweet the birds hush their singing.&#x201d; It is beautiful to think what the sound of one&#x2019;s own name would be, when the inflection of it would carry the meaning Mary heard in the unmistakable, familiar, and utterly unexpected voice of her friend and teacher. To propose analogies for the sound of it, a human name spoken in the world&#x2019;s new morning, would seem to trivialize it. I admire the tact of the lyric in making no attempt to evoke it, except obliquely, in the hush that falls over the birds. But it is nevertheless at the center of the meaning of this story that we <i>can</i> know something of the inflection of that voice. Christ&#x2019;s humanity is meant to speak to our humanity. We can in fact imagine that if someone we loved very deeply was restored to us, the joy in his or her voice would anticipate and share our joy. We can imagine how someone bringing us wonderful news might say our name tenderly to soften the shock of our delight. The mystery of Christ&#x2019;s humanity must make us wonder what of mortal memory he carried beyond the grave, and whether his pleasure at this encounter with Mary would have been shadowed and enriched by the fact that, not so long before, he had had no friend to watch with him even one hour. Scholars use the word &#x201c;pericope&#x201d;&#x2014;where does a story begin and end? How much we would know about this dawn, this meeting of friends in a garden, if only we could hear his voice.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tell my students, language is music. Written words are musical notation. The music of a piece of fiction establishes the way in which it is to be read, and, in the largest sense, what it means. It is essential to remember that characters have a music as well, a pitch and tempo, just as real people do. To make them believable, you must always be aware of what they would or would not say, where stresses would or would not fall. Those of us who claim to be Christian, Christ-like, generally assume we know what this word means, more or less&#x2014;that we know the character of Christ. For Protestants, this understanding of him is mediated through the Bible. Our saints and doctors, however brilliant and heroic, are rarely looked to for wisdom or example. The figure of Christ is our authority. No distinction can be made between his character and his meaning. No distinction can be made between his character and the great narrative of his life and death. But the fact is that we differ on this crucial point, on how we are to <i>see</i> the figure of Christ.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This scene, the account of the first hours of the Resurrection, written two thousand years ago in a dialect of an ancient language, by whom and in what circumstances no one can really know, inevitably raises questions. How faithfully did the writer&#x2019;s Greek approach the Aramaic of the original story&#x2014;assuming that Mary would have told the story in Aramaic, and that Jesus would have spoken to her in that language? And how faithful have all the generations of translation been since then to the writer&#x2019;s Greek? It must be said of the origins of this powerful text that the Lord made thick darkness its swaddling band.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We understand even the narrative of the origins of the narrative very differently. There are interpreters who insist on finding simplicity in just those matters where complexity is both great and salient. It is my feeling that reverence for the text obliges a respectful interest in its origins, and respect too for all its origins seem to imply about the kind of interpretation the text permits, as well as the kind it seems to preclude. I would say, for example, that the work of the group called the Jesus Seminar proceeded on assumptions that grossly simplify these questions and, in effect, impugn the authenticity of the text, as many writers have done over the last few centuries. Some humility would be appropriate&#x2014;there are those who earnestly believe that <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> was written by Truman Capote. The limits to what can be certainly known about such things are narrow at best. I suppose most Christians assume that the creation over time of the Gospels and the New Testament as a whole was an event of at least as great moment as the giving of the Law to Moses, or the moving of the Prophets to voice their oracles. The literal &#x201c;how&#x201d; of these events we cannot know, but we have the Law, and we have the poetry. If some intervening rabbinical hand strengthened or polished either of them, this may only have brought it closer to its true and original meaning. I am assuming here that Providence might be active in such matters.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To return again to what has been called &#x201c;the sword of the Lord&#x201d;: that phrase is itself an interpretation, since nothing in Jesus&#x2019;s words suggests that the sword should properly be called his. The note in the always useful 1560 edition of the Geneva Bible says of the divisions among families and households that are the effect of this sword, &#x201c;Which thing cometh not of the propertie of Christ, but proceedeth of the malice of men, who loveth not the light, but darkness, and are offended with the word of salvation.&#x201d; This same phrase does appear in Judges, where the sword is wielded by Gideon. The book of Judges is a somber and impressively clear-eyed account of the crimes and catastrophes that beset primitive Israel. If Gideon avenges his brothers in his rout of the Midianites, in doing this he also acquires power so coveted by his son Abimelech that he kills his seventy brothers in order to make himself Gideon&#x2019;s successor. And the phrase appears in fierce old Jeremiah, where it occurs as a lament: &#x201c;Ah, sword of the Lord! How long till you are quiet? Put yourself into your scabbard, rest and be still!&#x201d; (Jeremiah 47:6). The sword seems to have been wielded in this case by Nebuchadnezzar, who was attacking the Philistines. So this context does not support the idea that here violence is undertaken in the cause of righteousness by persons with any positive interest in the God of Israel. The prophet sees this disaster, like any other, as a judgment of the Lord, not as an endorsement of those who are his instruments in exacting it.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he spoke these words, Jesus might well have foreseen that in bringing a new understanding of a traditional faith he would divide families&#x2014;the &#x201c;sword&#x201d; he speaks of is the setting of fathers against sons and mothers against daughters. This is both inevitable and regrettable. In the narrative as I understand it, his words would be heavy with sorrow.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spent time over this phrase because it has been important in the history of Christendom and because I think it is important yet, an opinion I had arrived at <i>before</i> I looked it up on the Internet. Even among those Christians who are not so wedded to what some call literalism that they refuse to consider context, there is still an old habit of conflict within the house hold of Christ, the family of Christ, that flies in the face of that last...</p></p><h2>My Sister Saint Therese</h2><p>A little classic that is like a second Story of a Soul!

In 1916 Kaiser Wilhelm named Hindenburg to head the all-powerful Great German Staff with Ludendorff his deputy. At first all went well. But as food and other resources including replacements diminished, and as America entered the war, the top command increasingly panicked. In the summer of 1918 German armies in the west opened an all-out defensive. This failed and German surrender followed&#x2014;as did the fall of the German empire.</p><p>Former U.S. Marine captain and accomplished military historian Robert Asprey tells the story of the First World War from the point of view of the German general staff in <i>The German High Command at War</i>. Focusing on the celebrated partnership between general Erich Ludendorff and field marshal Paul von Hindenburg, Asprey recounts the duo's career from their early triumphs over the Russians at Tannenberg to the defeat of their military dictatorship in 1918.<p> Responding to historians who tend to lionize Hindenburg and Ludendorff, this book argues that their exemplary reputations were the result of a self-serving public-relations campaign during and after the war. Through Asprey's capable analysis, Ludendorff emerges as a fat, ruthless martinet, while Hindenburg looms as a passive, scheming narcissist. Their successes on the eastern front are portrayed as lucky breaks, the result of intercepted Russian radio transmissions. However, there were no respites on the western front, and Asprey explains how the generals' desperation, arrogance, and lack of strategic insight ultimately exhausted the German empire. Readers will find a comprehensive and lively treatment of Hindenburg and Ludendorff's military decisions and political intrigues, but this book is more than a history. Asprey's trenchant exploration of the dynamics of power and personality make <i>The German High Command at War</i> a warning for what can happen if militaristic imperatives dominate a government's capacity for principled leadership. <i>--James Highfill</i></p>A former Marine Corps captain and veteran of two wars, Asprey is an internationally known writer of military history.

There is no sense of the battlefield here, no surgical teams in gore-stained scrubs trading witty remarks about missing body parts, no steely-eyed administrators with their clipboards, no herds of old drunks in wheelchairs, and above all, no flocks of wide-eyed sheep huddled together in fear at what might come out of the double steel doors. There is no stench of blood, antiseptic, and terror; the smells here are kinder, homier. Even the colors are different: softer, more pastel, without the drab, battleship utilitarianism of the walls in other parts of the building. There are, in fact, none of the sights and sounds and dreadful smells I have come to associate with hospitals, none at all. There is only the crowd of moon-eyed men standing at the big window, and to my infinite surprise, I am one of them.<br><br>We stand together, happily pressed up to the glass and cheerfully making space for any newcomer. White, black, brown; Latin, African-American, Asian-American, Creole--it doesn't matter. We are all brothers. No one sneers or frowns; no one seems to care about getting an accidental nudge in the ribs now and again, and no one, wonder of all, seems to harbor any violent thoughts about any of the others. Not even me. Instead, we all cluster at the glass, looking at the miraculous commonplace in the next room.<br><br>Are these human beings? Can this really be the Miami I have always lived in? Or has some strange physics experiment in an underground supercollider sent us all to live in Bizarro World, where everyone is kind and tolerant and happy all the time?<br><br>Where is the joyfully homicidal crowd of yesteryear? Where are the well-armed, juiced-up, half-crazed, ready-to-kill friends of my youth? Has all this changed, vanished, washed away forever in the light from yonder window?<br><br>What fantastic vision beyond the glass has taken a hallway filled with normal, wicked, face-breaking, neck-snapping humans and turned them into a clot of bland and drooling happy-wappys?<br><br>Unbelieving, I look again, and there it is. There it still is. Four neat rows of pink and brown, tiny wiggling creatures, so small and prunish and useless--and yet it is they who have turned this crowd of healthy, kill-crazy humans into a half-melted splotch of dribbling helplessness. And beyond this mighty feat of magic, even more absurd and dramatic and unbelievable, one of those tiny pink lumps has taken our Dark Dabbler, Dexter the Decidedly Dreadful, and made him, too, into a thing of quiet and contemplative chin spittle. And there it lies, waving its toes at the strip lights, utterly unaware of the miracle it has performed--unaware, indeed, even of the very toes it wiggles, for it is the absolute Avatar of Unaware--and yet, look what it has done in all its unthinking, unknowing wigglehood. Look at it there, the small, wet, sour-smelling marvel that has changed everything.<br><br>Lily Anne.<br><br>Three small and very ordinary syllables. Sounds with no real meaning--and yet strung together and attached to the tiny lump of flesh that squirms there on its pedestal, it has performed the mightiest of magical feats. It has turned Dexter Dead for Decades into something with a heart that beats and pumps true life, something that almost feels, that so very nearly resembles a human being--<br><br>There: It waves one small and mighty hand and that New Thing inside Dexter waves back. Something turns over and surges upward into the chest cavity, bounces off the ribs and attacks the facial muscles, which now spread into a spontaneous and unpracticed smile. Heavens above, was that really an emotion? Have I fallen so far, so fast?<br><br>Yes, apparently I have. There it goes again.<br><br>Lily Anne.<br><br>"Your first?" says a voice beside me, and I glance to my left--quickly, so as not to miss a single second of the spectacle on the far side of the window. A stocky Latin man stands there in jeans and a clean work shirt with Manny stitched over the pocket.<br><br>"Yes," I say, and he nods.<br><br>"I got three," he says, and smiles. "I don't get tired of it, either."<br><br>"No," I say, looking back at Lily Anne. "How could you?" She is moving her other hand now--and now both at the same time! What a remarkable child.<br><br>"Two boys," he says, shaking his head, and adds, "and at last, a girl." And I can tell from the tone of his voice that this thought makes him smile and I sneak another glance at him; sure enough, his face is stretched into an expression of happy pride that is nearly as stupid-looking as my own. "Boys can be so dumb," he says. "I really wanted a girl this time, and . . ." His smile stretches even wider and we stand together for several minutes in companionable silence, contemplating our bright and beautiful girls beyond the glass.<br><br>Lily Anne.<br><br>Lily Anne Morgan. Dexter's DNA, living and moving on through time to another generation, and more, into the far-flung future, a day beyond imagination--taking the very essence of all that is me and moving it forward past the clock-fingered reach of death, sprinting into tomorrow wrapped in Dexter's chromosomes--and looking very good doing it. Or so it seems to her loopy father.<br><br>Everything has changed. A world with Lily Anne Morgan in it is so completely unknown: prettier, cleaner, neater edges, brighter colors. Things taste better now, even the Snickers bar and cup of vending machine coffee, all I have had for twenty-four hours. The candy bar's flavor was far more subtle than I had known before, and the coffee tasted of hope. Poetry flows into my icy cold brain and trickles down to my fingertips, because all is new and wonderful now. And far beyond the taste of the coffee is the taste of life itself. Now it is something to nurture, protect, and delight in. And the thought comes from far out beyond bizarre that perhaps life is no longer something to feed on in the terrible dark frenzy of joy that has defined me until this new apocalyptic moment. Maybe Dexter's world should die now, and a new world of pink delight will spring from the ashes. And the old and terrible need to slash the sheep and scatter the bones, to spin through the wicked night like a thresher, to seed the moonlight with the tidy leftovers of Dexter's Dark Desiring? Maybe it's time to let it go, time to let it drain away until it is all gone, vanished utterly.<br><br>Lily Anne is here and I want to be different.<br><br>I want to be better than what I have been.<br><br>I want to hold her. I want to sit her on my lap and read her Christopher Robin and Dr. Seuss. I want to brush her hair and teach her about toothpaste and put Band-Aids on her knees. I want to hug her in the sunset in a room full of puppies while the band plays "Happy Birthday," and watch her grow up into wonderful beautiful cancer-curing symphony-writing adulthood, and to do that I cannot be who I have always been--and that is fine with me, because I realize one more important thing.<br><br>I don't want to be Dark Dexter anymore.<br><br>The thought is not so much a shock as a completion. I have lived my life moving in one direction and now I am there. I don't need to do those things anymore. No regrets, but no longer necessary. Now there is Lily Anne and she trumps all that other dancing in the dark. It is time to move on, time to evolve! Time to leave Old Devil Dexter behind in the dust. That part of me is complete, and now--<br><br>Now there is one small and very sour note singing in the choir of Dexter's happiness. Something is not quite right. Somewhere nearby some small gleam of the old wicked life flashes through the rosy glow of the new and a dry rattle of scales grates across the new melody.<br><br>Someone is watching me.<br><br>The thought comes as a silky whisper only one step removed from a chuckle. The Dark Passenger, as ever, is amused at the timing as well as the sentiment--but there is truth in the warning, too, and I turn very casual-careful, smile now stitched in place in the old fake way, and I scan the hallway behind me: first to the left, toward the vending machines. An old man, his shirt tucked into pants pulled much too high, leans against the soda machine with his eyes closed. A nurse walks by without seeing him.<br><br>I turn and look to the right, down to where the hallway ends in a "T" that goes one way to a row of rooms and the other way to the elevators. And there it is, as plain as a blip on any radar screen, or what is left of the blip, because someone is going around the corner toward the elevators, and all I can see is half his back as he scuttles away. Tan pants, a greenish plaid shirt, and the bottom of one athletic shoe, and he is gone, and he does not leave any explanation at all of why he was watching me, but I know that he was, and this is confirmed by the cheesy smirk I feel oozing from the Passenger, as if to say, Oh, really, we're leaving what behind?<br><br>I know of no reason in this world, or any other, why anyone would be interested in little old me. My conscience is as clean and empty as it can possibly be--which means, of course, that I have always tidied up carefully, and in any case, my conscience has the same hard reality as a unicorn.<br><br>But someone very definitely was watching me and this is oh-so-more-than-slightly bothersome, because I can think of no wholesome and happy reason why anyone would want to watch Dull-as-Dishwater Dexter, and I must now think that whatever threatens Dexter might also be a danger to Lily Anne--and this is not a thing that I can allow.<br><br>And of course the Passenger finds this highly amusing: that moments ago I was sniffing the bright buds of spring and forswearing the way of all flesh, and now I am once again up on point and eager to slay--but this is different. This is not recreational homicide. This is protecting Lily Anne, and even after these very first moments of life, I will quite happily rip the veins out of anything that comes near her, and it is with this comforting thought that I stroll to the corner of the hall and glance toward the elevator.<br><br>But there is nothing there. The hallway is empty.<br><br>I have only a few seconds to stare, barely enough time to enjoy my own slack-jawed silence, and my cell phone begins to vibrate on my hip. I draw it from its holster and glance at the number; it is Sergeant Deborah, my own adopted flesh and blood, my cop sister, no doubt calling to coo over the arrival of Lily Anne and offer me sibling best wishes. So I answer the phone.<br><br>"Hi," I say.<br><br>"Dexter," she says. "We got a shit-storm and I need you. Get down here right away."<br><br>"I'm not on duty right now," I say. "I'm on paternity leave." But before I can reassure her that Lily Anne is fine and beautiful and Rita is in a deep sleep down the hall, she gives me an address and hangs up.<br><br>I went back and said good-bye to Lily Anne. She waved her toes, rather fondly, I thought, but she didn't say anything.<br>TWO<br><br>The address Deborah gave me was in an old part of Coconut Grove, which meant there were no high-rises or guard booths. The houses were small and eccentric, and all the trees and bushes spread up and out into an overgrown riot of green that hid almost everything except the actual road. The street itself was small and darkened by the canopy of overhanging banyans, and there was barely room for me to steer my car through the dozen or so official vehicles that had already arrived and claimed all the parking spots. I managed to find a crevice beside a sprawling bamboo plant about a block away; I wedged my car in and took the long hike back, lugging my blood-spatter kit. It seemed much heavier than usual, but perhaps it was just that being so far from Lily Anne sapped my strength.<br><br>The house was modest and mostly hidden by plant life. It had a flat, tilted roof of the kind that had been "modern" forty years ago, and there was a strange and twisted chunk of metal out front that was probably supposed to be a sculpture of some kind. It stood in a pool of water, and a fountain squirted up next to it. Altogether it was the very picture of Old Coconut Grove.<br><br>I noticed that several of the cars parked in front looked rather federal motor pool-ish, and sure enough, when I got inside there were a couple of gray suits in among the blue uniforms and pastel guayaberas of the home team. They were all milling about in clusters, a kind of colloidal motion made up of groups--some doing question and answer, some forensics, and others just staring around for something important to do to justify the expense of driving over here and standing at a crime scene.<br><br>Deborah was in a group that could best be described as confrontational, which was no surprise to those who know her and love her. She was facing two of the suits, one of them a female FBI agent I knew, Special Agent Brenda Recht. My nemesis, Sergeant Doakes, had sicced her on me when an attempted kidnapping of my stepkids, Cody and Astor, had gone down. Even filled with the good sergeant's helpful paranoia she had not managed to prove anything against me, but she had been deeply suspicious, and I was not looking forward to renewing my acquaintance with her.<br><br>Standing beside her was a man I can only describe as a generic fed, with a gray suit and white shirt and shiny black shoes. They were both facing my sister, Sergeant Deborah, and another man I didn't know. He was blond, about six feet tall, muscular, and absurdly good-looking in a rugged, masculine way, as if God had taken Brad Pitt and decided to make him really handsome. He was staring off to the side at a floor lamp while Deborah snarled something forceful at Special Agent Recht. As I approached, Deborah glanced up and caught my eye, turned back to Special Agent Recht, and said, "Now keep your goddamned wingtips out of my crime scene! I have real work to do," and she turned away and took my arm, saying, "Over here. Take a look at this."</p><h2>Killer Elite: The Inside Story of America&#39;s Most Secret Special Operations Team</h2><p><br><br><p>A top-secret U.S. Army Special Operations unit has been running covert missions all over the world, from leading&nbsp;death squads&nbsp;to the hideout of drug baron Pablo Escobar to assassinating key al Qaeda members, including Iraqi leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and, in one of their greatest missions, capturing Saddam Hussein. 'The Activity,&#x201d; as it became known to insiders, has achieved near-mythical status, even among the world's Special Operations elite. Hidden from the politicians and the government bean counters, The Activity has been carrying out deniable operations, preparing the way for Delta and SEAL Team Six.</p><p>Now journalist Michael Smith gets inside this clandestine military team to expose their explosive history and secrets. Smith has spoken to many former members of the Activity and reveals the incredible truth behind the world's most secret Special Operations organization, a unit that is at the forefront of the War on Terror.</p><br><br></p><p><br><p>Michael Smith writes on defense for the <i>Sunday Times</i> of London. A former member of the British Army&#x2019;s Intelligence Corps, Smith covered the wars in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq and has broken a number of important stories. He is the award-winning author of numerous bestselling books, including&nbsp;<i>The Emperor's Code,</i> a&nbsp;true story of code-breaking during World War II.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br>Chapter 1<br>Sitting in the forward operations center in a filthy Egyptian Air Force hangar at the Wadi Qina air base, 300 miles south of Cairo, Colonel Jerry King was powerless to prevent the debacle at Desert One. As chief of staff to Major General James &#x201c;Hammer&#x201d; Vaught, the man in charge of the Delta Force attempt to rescue 53 American hostages held captive in Tehran, King could only listen with mounting anger to the frantic satellite radio messages coming out of Iran in the early hours of 25 April 1980. Not that anyone out there at the Desert One staging post, 250 miles southeast of the Iranian capital in the Dasht-e-Kavir desert, could do any better. Even Chargin&#x2019; Charlie Beckwith, the former Green Beret colonel who set up Delta and was leading Operation Eagle Claw on the ground, couldn&#x2019;t prevent what was by any measure &#x201c;a total goat-fuck&#x201d; that left eight US servicemen dead.<br>The operation had been called off after three of the eight US Navy helicopters taking part in the mission developed technical problems that left the joint task force with too few to get both the hostages and the rescue team out. One was abandoned in the desert after an indicator light warned a rotor blade might snap, a second had to pull out of the mission when its gyroscope malfunctioned and the third was declared unserviceable after landing at Desert One. After some argument among the task force commanders over whether or not to go ahead, the mission was called off. It was then that a helicopter and one of the C130s collided, killing the eight US servicemen.<br>There was a whole bunch of reasons why they died and why the task force failed in its mission&#x2014;the interservice rivalry that meant every one of the four armed services wanted some involvement in the mission regardless of the fact that they had never worked together before, and all used different operating procedures; the decision to fly the helicopters off an aircraft carrier rather than in from a neighboring country; the navy&#x2019;s poor maintenance of its helicopters; and the strange decision not to have air force pilots with experience of special ops fly all the aircraft, a move that would have at least ensured the mission got beyond Desert One.<br>But even if it had, there was another major problem that could have led to the mission failing at its most dangerous point, inside Tehran itself, and afterward Jerry King, a straight-talking veteran of Army Special Forces operations along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, was not slow to make his views known. The CIA had fucked up big time. It had claimed, falsely as it later turned out, to have no one in Tehran who could help Delta prepare for what was always going to be a tricky task. King&#x2019;s disparaging view of the Agency&#x2019;s contribution was shared by virtually everyone else involved in Eagle Claw, not least the task force commander General Vaught. &#x201c;Intelligence from all sources was inadequate from the start and never became responsive,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The CIA did not, would not or could not provide sufficient agents to go in country and get the information we needed.&#x201d;1<br>whatever the reasons for the failure of Eagle Claw, it certainly wasn&#x2019;t a lack of detailed planning. Preparations for the raid had begun six months earlier on 4 November 1979, the very day a mob of Iranian Revolutionary Guards and militant students, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini, forced their way into the US embassy in Tehran and seized the hostages. Jerry King, who was then chief of unconventional warfare for special operations in the Joint Chiefs of Staff operations directorate, was called in by Air Force General David C Jones, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, together with the chief of current operations, Brigadier General Johnson. &#x201c;We were told about the embassy seizure and I was ordered to develop some military options by the following morning,&#x201d; King recalled. &#x201c;I was forbidden to inform or involve anyone else, including my immediate superior.&#x201d;<br>Jones eventually backed down slightly to allow King to bring in two of his special operations colleagues so there were at least navy and air force representatives involved in his special planning cell, which was set up in the Pentagon&#x2019;s Eighth Corridor close to the River entrance. Those three men were to become the nucleus of the task force commanded by Jim Vaught, who was described by John T Carney, one of the US Air Force special operations officers brought in to set up the Desert One forward operating base, as &#x201c;a tall, lean, scraggly, quiet, gravely voiced but soft-spoken infantryman.&#x201d;2 The unit Vaught and King picked to execute the actual rescue mission was the newly formed Special Forces Operational Detachment&#x2014;Delta, the counterterrorist force that Beckwith had just recently set up, modeling it on the British Special Air Service (SAS), to provide the US with a counterterrorist team. Delta was based in the Stockade, an old military prison at the Army Special Forces headquarters at Fort Bragg, Fayetteville, North Carolina. Beckwith and King were both veterans of special ops in Vietnam and had learned a lot about their trade serving alongside members of the SAS. &#x201c;I had an SAS sergeant assigned to me at Fort Bragg in the early sixties,&#x201d; King recalled. It was part of the exchange mission that provided the inspiration for Delta. The sergeant and an SAS officer were sent to Fort Bragg while Charlie Beckwith and a Green Beret sergeant went to the SAS base at Bradbury Lines, Hereford, in England. For Jerry King, time spent with the highly experienced SAS sergeant was deeply rewarding. &#x201c;I was wet behind the ears,&#x201d; King said. &#x201c;He taught me how to walk.&#x201d;<br>Born in Canton, North Carolina, in 1937, Jerry King was an army brat, brought up at military bases in Germany, Korea and the Philippines. His stepfather was a career noncommissioned officer in the US Army. King enlisted into the army&#x2019;s airborne infantry and after swift promotion through the ranks was picked out as a potential officer. The rookie lieutenant&#x2019;s first posting was as a platoon commander in Germany. &#x201c;Facing the Fulda Gap and the possibility of a Soviet thrust, I began to realize that my survival was dramatically enhanced when I had more control over my unit&#x2019;s actions,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The arrogance of the young but a belief reinforced over time.&#x201d;<br>As a direct result of that conviction, Jerry King developed a hard-nosed attitude that would win him a great deal of respect, and quite a few enemies, in his chosen field of special operations. At 6 foot 2 inches and weighing in at just under 196 pounds, King was a born winner. There might be others who were fitter, but very few could outlast him. Whether it was swimming underwater in preparation for covert approaches on targets or running marathons, he had the kind of mentality that meant he wouldn&#x2019;t give in. He joined the 77th Special Forces Group (Airborne) at Fort Bragg and was sent to Laos at the head of one of the White Star mobile training teams, which were training local forces to counter North Vietnam&#x2019;s use of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the Viet Cong supply route that ran through Laos and Cambodia into South Vietnam. King subsequently led a Special Forces detachment in Vietnam and helped to set up the training program for the Studies and Observations Group (SOG), the euphemistically named special operations command which, between January 1965 and March 1973, mounted several thousand highly success-<br>ful cross-border reconnaissance missions into Laos, Cambodia and North Vietnam. At 28, King was deemed &#x201c;too old&#x201d; for the gruelling missions but on a couple of occasions he managed to bypass the naysayers and went across the border anyway.3<br>He had known Charlie Beckwith when they were both young lieutenants and was not the Delta commander&#x2019;s greatest fan, but that didn&#x2019;t affect his judgment that Delta was &#x201c;the obvious choice for the entry force.&#x201d; The first suggestion was that the raid to rescue the hostages should be mounted from eastern Turkey, which seemed a sensible option, allowing total flexibility in the type of aircraft used on the rescue mission and a safe base just across the border from Iran. But inexplicably General Jones ruled out the use of Turkey and two other friendly Middle East countries. &#x201c;What I considered a purely political and unreasonable decision by the Chairman forced us to look for an alternative launch platform,&#x201d; King recalled. &#x201c;Carriers were the only feasible option available.&#x201d;4<br>Eventually it was decided that the MC130 Combat Talon aircraft carrying the Delta personnel and a small security force of US Rangers would take off from Wadi Qina, making a brief stopover at the British air base on the island of Masirah, off Oman, while the helicopters that were to carry the Delta teams into a hide site close to Tehran and exfiltrate them, along with the hostages, would launch from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz in the Gulf of Oman. That last decision created a whole raft of problems that would ultimately lead to the failure of the mission.<br>&#x201c;The choice of a carrier as a launch platform virtually dictated the type of aircraft,&#x201d; King said. They would be US Navy RH53 Sea Stallions, normally used for mine-clearing operations but big enough to carry the hostages and the Delta rescue team out of Iran to safety. It didn&#x2019;t take long for King to realize that the navy pilots who flew the aircraft were simply not good enough. &#x201c;I recommended we bring in air force pilots who flew the same helicopter with considerable long flight experience, including one who had participated in the Son Tay raid.&#x201d; But the senior officer he had to ask for authorization to replace the navy pilots was a US Marine general and the interservice rivalry that would bedevil the Eagle Claw mission took over. &#x201c;Bef...<br><br></p><h2>The Spiritual Lives of Great Composers</h2><p>Patrick Kavanaugh uncovers the spirituality of twenty of music&#39;s timeless giants, revealing legacies of the soul as diverse as the masterpieces they created.

Not even some of the greatest geniuses in history, as Mario Livio tells us in this marvelous story of scientific error and breakthrough.<br> <br>Charles Darwin, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Linus Pauling, Fred Hoyle, and Albert Einstein were all brilliant scientists. Each made groundbreaking contributions to his field&#x2014;but each also stumbled badly. Darwin&#x2019;s theory of natural selection shouldn&#x2019;t have worked, according to the prevailing beliefs of his time. Not until Gregor Mendel&#x2019;s work was known would there be a mechanism to explain natural selection. How could Darwin be both wrong and right? Lord Kelvin, Britain&#x2019;s leading scientific intellect at the time, gravely miscalculated the age of the earth. Linus Pauling, the world&#x2019;s premier chemist (who would win the Nobel Prize in chemistry) constructed an erroneous model for DNA in his haste to beat the competition to publication. Astrophysicist Fred Hoyle dismissed the idea of a &#x201c;Big Bang&#x201d; origin to the universe (ironically, the caustic name he gave to this event endured long after his erroneous objections were disproven). And Albert Einstein, whose name is synonymous with genius, speculated incorrectly about the forces that hold the universe in equilibrium&#x2014;and that speculation opened the door to brilliant conceptual leaps. These five scientists expanded our knowledge of life on earth, the evolution of the earth itself, and the evolution of the universe, despite and because of their errors. As Mario Livio luminously explains, the scientific process advances through error. Mistakes are essential to progress. <br> <br><i>Brilliant Blunders </i>is a singular tour through the world of science and scientific achievement&#x2014;and a wonderfully insightful examination of the psychology of five fascinating scientists.</p><p>Mario Livio is an internationally known astrophysicist, a bestselling author, and a popular speaker who has appeared on&nbsp;<i>The Daily Show</i>,&nbsp;<i>60 Minutes</i>, and&nbsp;<i>NOVA</i>.

I developed a standard answer: &#x201c;It is about blunders, and it is not an autobiography!&#x201d; This would get a few laughs and the occasional approbation &#x201c;What an interesting idea.&#x201d; My objective was simple: to correct the impression that scientific breakthroughs are purely success stories. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. Not only is the road to triumph paved with blunders, but the bigger the prize, the bigger the potential blunder.<br> <br>Immanuel Kant, the great German philosopher, wrote famously, &#x201c;Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more often and steadily we reflect upon them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.&#x201d; In the time that has passed since the publication of his The Critique of Practical Reason (1788), we have made impressive progress in understanding the former; considerably less so, in my humble opinion, in elucidating the latter. It is apparently much more difficult to make life or mind comprehensible to itself. Nevertheless, the life sciences in general&#x2014;and the research into the operation of the human brain in particular&#x2014;are truly picking up speed. So it may not be altogether inconceivable after all that one day we will even fully understand why evolution has concocted a sentient species.<br> <br>While this book is about some of the remarkable endeavors to figure out life and the cosmos, it is more concerned with the journey than with the destination.

His books are sold world-wide in more than 20 countries and have been translated into a dozen languages including French, German, Italian and Spanish.In this debut thriller, bitter men chase the single sweet thing life has to offer them: revenge. David Sloane, however, is not among the vengeful. Though a decorated ex-marine, he&#39;s on the mild-mannered side, an ordinary citizen, a hard-working lawyer-brilliant, successful, but lonely, too, more so than he&#39;s prepared to acknowledge even to himself. Practicing in San Francisco, he&#39;s had 14 noteworthy wins in a row, and no one who&#39;s seen him sway a jury predicts a snapped string in the foreseeable future. And yet someone out there doesn&#39;t like him. Or, to put a slightly different spin on it, someone has singled him out for negative attention. His apartment has been ransacked, but nothing is missing. Clearly, an error has been made, David tells himself at first-mistaken identity. Wrong. And soon enough, mysteriously, he comes into possession of something ruthless people will unhesitatingly kill for-a file. It contains a 30-year-old secret, so wicked, so blood-drenched and so explosive that the nation&#39;s corridors of power would be cluttered with trashed careers if it were to be revealed. It also contains information important to David for highly personal reasons. In search of dangerous truths, David begins a perilous journey. During it, he finds friends and allies, a woman to love and a whole series of implacable enemies. Dugoni&#39;s well out in front until the last 50 pages or so when an unfortunate fusion of over-cooked plotting and overwrought prose results in a tumble. Still, a writer to watch.

She&#x2019;d spent the last ninety minutes standing in two-inch heels at a charity art auction in a swanky studio in downtown Chicago. She couldn&#x2019;t understand how shoes that matched her black dress so beautifully could be this painful. Vanity, thy name is fashion.<br><br>&#x201c;My name is spelled with two l&#x2019;s,&#x201d; the middle-aged woman, dripping in diamonds, reminded her. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Michelle, with two l&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Got it.&#x201d; Carrie underlined the correct spelling. Michelle, spelled with two l&#x2019;s, had just spent thirty thousand dollars for the most ridiculous piece of art Carrie had ever seen. True, it was for a good cause, but now she seemed to feel her name needed to be mentioned in the news article Carrie would write for the next edition of the Chicago Herald.<br><br>&#x201c;It would be wonderful to have my husband&#x2019;s and my picture to go along with your article,&#x201d; Michelle added. &#x201c;Perhaps you should take it in front of the painting.&#x201d;<br><br>Carrie looked over her shoulder at Harry, the photographer who&#x2019;d accompanied her from the newspaper.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, Lloyd and I would want approval of any photograph you choose to publish.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Carrie said, doing her best to keep a smile in place. If she didn&#x2019;t get out of these shoes soon, her feet would be permanently deformed. She wiggled her toes, hoping for relief. Instead they ached even worse.<br><br>Harry, bless his heart, dutifully stepped forward, camera in hand, and flashed two or three photos of the couple posing in front of what might have been a red flower or a painting of a squished tomato or possibly the aftermath of a murder scene. Carrie had yet to decide which. The title of the work didn&#x2019;t offer a clue. Red. Yes, the painting was in that color, but exactly what it depicted remained a mystery.<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it stunning?&#x201d; Michelle asked when she noticed Carrie staring at the canvas.<br><br>Carrie tilted her head one way and then another, looking for some clue as to its possible significance. Then, noticing that Michelle, spelled with two l&#x2019;s, was waiting for her response, she said, &#x201c;Oh, yes, it&#x2019;s amazing.&#x201d;<br><br>Harry didn&#x2019;t bother to hide his smile, knowing that all Carrie really wanted was to get out of those ridiculous shoes. And to think she&#x2019;d gotten her journalism degree for this!<br><br>Carrie knew she was fortunate to have a job with such a prestigious newspaper. A professor had pulled a favor and gotten her the interview. Carrie had been stunned when she&#x2019;d been hired. Surprised and overjoyed.<br><br>Two years later, she was less so. Her assignment was the society page. When she was hired, she&#x2019;d been told that eventually she&#x2019;d be able to write meatier pieces, do interviews and human-interest stories. To this point, it hadn&#x2019;t happened. Carrie felt trapped, frustrated, and underappreciated. She felt her talent was being wasted.<br><br>To make matters worse, her entire family lived in the Pacific Northwest. Carrie had left everything she knew and loved behind, including Steve, her college sweetheart. He&#x2019;d married less than six months after she took the position in Chicago. It hadn&#x2019;t taken him long, she noted. The worst part was that Carrie was far too busy reporting on social events to have time for much of a social life herself. She dated occasionally, but she hadn&#x2019;t found anyone who made her heart race. Dave Schneider, the man she&#x2019;d been seeing most recently, was more of a friend than a love interest. She supposed after Steve she was a bit hesitant to get involved again. Maybe once she left the Herald and moved home to write for a newspaper in the Seattle area, like she planned, things would be different.<br><br>Back inside her condo, Carrie gingerly removed her shoes and sighed with relief.<br><br>This was it. She was done. First thing in the morning she would hand in her two-week notice, sublet her condo, and take her chances in the job market in Seattle. If the managing editor, Nash Jorgen, refused to give her the opportunity to prove she had what it took, then why stay? She refused to be pigeonholed.<br><br>That decided, Carrie limped into her bedroom and fell into bed, tired, frustrated, and determined to make a change.<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be serious,&#x201d; argued Sophie Peterson, her closest friend at the newspaper, when Carrie told her of her decision.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m totally serious,&#x201d; she said as she hobbled to her desk.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with your foot?&#x201d; Sophie asked, tagging behind her.<br><br>&#x201c;Stupidity. This gorgeous pair of shoes was only available in a half-size smaller than what I normally wear. They were so perfect, and they were buy one pair, get the second half off. I couldn&#x2019;t resist, but now I&#x2019;m paying for it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Carrie, don&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, I have no intention of wearing those heels again. I tossed them in a bag for charity.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not that,&#x201d; Sophie argued. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t hand in your notice! You&#x2019;re needed here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not as a reporter,&#x201d; Carrie assured her, dumping her purse in her bottom drawer and shucking off her thick winter coat. &#x201c;Sorry, my mind is made up. You and I both know Nash will never give me a decent assignment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re your own worst enemy.&#x201d; Sophie leaned against the wall that separated their two cubicles and crossed her arms and ankles.<br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, for one thing, you&#x2019;re the perfect fit for the society page. You&#x2019;re drop-dead gorgeous, tall, and thin. It doesn&#x2019;t hurt that you look fabulous in a slinky black dress and a pair of spike heels. Even if I could get my hair to grow that thick, long, and curly without perming the living daylights out of it, Nash would never consider someone like me. It isn&#x2019;t any wonder he wants you on the job. Give the guy a little credit, will you? He knows what he&#x2019;s doing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If looks are the only criterion&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s more,&#x201d; Sophie said, cutting her off. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re great with people. All you need to do is bat those baby blues at them and strangers open up to you. It&#x2019;s a gift, I tell you, a real gift.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;m friendly, but this isn&#x2019;t the kind of writing I want to do. I&#x2019;ve got my heart set on being a reporter, a real reporter, writing about real news and interesting people.&#x201d; In the beginning, Carrie had been flattered by the way people went out of their way to introduce themselves at the events she covered. It didn&#x2019;t take long for her to recognize that they were looking for her to mention their names in print. What shocked her was the extent people were willing to go in order to be noticed. She was quickly becoming jaded, and this bothered her even more than Nash&#x2019;s lack of faith in her abilities.<br><br>The holidays were the worst, and while it was only early November, the frenzy had already started. The list of parties Nash assigned her to attend was already mammoth. Halloween decorations were still arranged around her desk, and already there was a Christmas tree in the display window of the department store across the street.<br><br>Determined to stick with her plan, Carrie went directly into Nash Jorgen&#x2019;s office.<br><br>A veteran newsman, Nash glanced up from his computer screen and glared in her direction. He seemed to sense this wasn&#x2019;t a social visit. His shoulders rose with a weary sigh. &#x201c;What now?&#x201d; he growled.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m handing in my two-week notice.&#x201d; If she&#x2019;d been looking for a response, she would have been disappointed.<br><br>He blinked a couple of times, ran his hand down the side of his day-old beard, and asked, &#x201c;Any particular reason?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hoped to prove I can be a darn good reporter, but I&#x2019;ll never get the chance writing anything more than copy for society weddings. You said when you hired me that you&#x2019;d give me a shot at reporting real news.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember what I said. What&#x2019;s wrong with what you&#x2019;re writing now? You&#x2019;re good.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t what I want to write.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So? You make the best of it, pay your dues, and in time you&#x2019;ll get the break you&#x2019;re looking for.&#x201d;<br><br>Carrie was tired of waiting. She straightened her shoulders, her resolve tightening. &#x201c;I know I&#x2019;m fortunate to work for the Herald. It was a real coup to get this position, but this isn&#x2019;t the career I wanted. You give me no choice.&#x201d; She set her letter of resignation on his desk.<br><br>That got Nash&#x2019;s attention. He swiveled his chair around to look at her once more. His frown darkened, and he ran his hand through his thinning hair. &#x201c;You really are serious, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>A chill went down her spine. Nash was actually listening. &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m serious.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine, then.&#x201d; He reached across his desk and picked up a hardcover book and handed it to her. &#x201c;Find Finn Dalton, get an interview, and write me a story I can print.&#x201d;<br><br>She grabbed hold of the book, not recognizing the author&#x2019;s name. &#x201c;And if I do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, first, there&#x2019;s a snowball&#x2019;s chance of you even locating him. Every reporter in the universe is dying to interview him. But if you get lucky and he&#x2019;s willing to talk and we print the piece, then I&#x2019;ll take you off the society page.&#x201d;<br><br>Carrie wavered. He seemed to be offering her a chance, as impossible as it might seem. Now it was up to her to prove herself. She dared not show him how excited she was. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll find him.&#x201d;<br><br>He snickered as though he found her confidence amusing, and then sobered. He regarded her with the same dark frown he had earlier before a slow, easy smile slid over his harsh features. &#x201c;I bet you will. Now, listen up&#x2014;if you get an interview with Finn Dalton, you can have any assignment you want.&#x201d;<br><br>Taking small steps, Carrie backed out of the office. She pointed at Nash. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m holding you to your word.&#x201d;<br><br>The managing editor was already back to reading his computer screen and didn&#x2019;t appear to have heard her. It didn&#x2019;t matter; she&#x2019;d heard him, and he&#x2019;d come across loud and clear.<br><br>Once she was out of his office, she examined the book to see the author photo, but couldn&#x2019;t find one, not even on the inside back flap.<br><br>Walking back to her cubicle, she paused at Sophie&#x2019;s instead. &#x201c;You ever heard of Finn Dalton?&#x201d;<br><br>Sophie&#x2019;s eyebrows lifted on her round face. &#x201c;You mean you haven&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; The book title wasn&#x2019;t much help. Alone. That told her next to nothing. The jacket revealed a snow-covered landscape with a scattering of stubby trees.<br><br>Sophie shook her head. &#x201c;Have you been living under a rock?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Who is this guy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a survivalist who lives alone someplace in the Alaskan wilderness.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; That was a bit daunting, but Carrie considered herself up to the challenge. She&#x2019;d been born and raised in Washington state. She&#x2019;d hoped to join her family for Thanksgiving, but if she needed to use her vacation time to find Finn Dalton, then she was willing to.<br><br>&#x201c;His book has been on the bestseller lists for nearly seven months, mostly at the number-one position.&#x201d;<br><br>Carrie was impressed. &#x201c;What does he write about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s the kind of guy you can set loose in the wild with a pack of chewing gum, a pocketknife, and a handkerchief, and by the time you find him he&#x2019;s built a shelter and a canoe. From what I&#x2019;ve read, his stories about Alaskan life and survival in the tundra would kink your hair. Well, not that yours needs curling.&#x201d;<br><br>This was Sophie&#x2019;s idea of a joke. Carrie&#x2019;s wild dark brown curls were the bane of her existence. She tamed them as best she could, but she often found herself the brunt of jokes over her out-of-control hair.<br><br>&#x201c;Nash says he doesn&#x2019;t give interviews.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not just doesn&#x2019;t give interviews&#x2014;this guy is like a ghost. No one has ever met or even talked to him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Surely his publisher or his editor&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Sophie said, cutting her off. &#x201c;Everything has been done by computer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, then . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All anyone knows is that he lives near an Alaskan lake somewhere in the vicinity of the Arctic Circle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How is it you know so much about this guy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t, and that&#x2019;s just it. No one does. The press has gone wild looking for him. Plenty of reporters have tried to track him down, without success. No one knows how to find him, and Finn Dalton doesn&#x2019;t want to be found. He should have called his book Leave Me Alone. Someone could pass him on the street and never know it was him, and from everything I&#x2019;ve read, that&#x2019;s exactly how he likes it.&#x201d;<br><br>Intrigued, Carrie flipped through the pages of the book. &#x201c;Nash said I could have any assignment I wanted if I got an interview from Finn Dalton.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course he did. Nash has been around long enough to know he&#x2019;s got you in a no-win situation.&#x201d;<br><br>Carrie glanced up. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care. I&#x2019;m going to try.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hate to be a killjoy here, but Carrie, no way will you find this guy. Better reporters than either of us have tried and failed. Every newspaper, magazine, and media outlet is looking to dig up information about him, without success. Finn Dalton doesn&#x2019;t want to be found.&#x201d;<br><br>That might be the case, but Carrie refused to give up without even trying. This was far too important to drop just because it was a long shot. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m desperate, Sophie.&#x201d; And really, that said it all. If she was going to have a real career in journalism, she had to find Finn Dalton. Her entire future with the Chicago Herald hung in the balance.<br><br>&#x201c;I admire your determination,&#x201d; Sophie murmured, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m afraid you&#x2019;re going to hit one dead end after another.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That might be the case.&#x201d; Carrie was willing to admit to her friend that finding Finn Dalton wouldn&#x2019;t be easy. &#x201c;But I refuse to quit without trying.&#x201d; She knew Sophie didn&#x2019;t mean to be negative. &#x201c;I want this chance, and if it means tracking Finn Dalton into some forsaken tundra, then I will put on my big-girl shoes and go for it.&#x201d; But not the heels she&#x2019;d worn last night, that was for sure.<br><br>The first thing Carrie did in her search for Finn Dalton was read the book. Not once, but three times. She underlined everything that gave her a single hint as to his identity.<br><br>For two days she skipped lunch, spending her time on the computer, seeking any bit of information she could find that would help her locate Finn Dalton. She went from one search engine to another.<br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s it going?&#x201d; Sophie asked as they passed each other on their way out the door a couple of days later.<br><br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; Through her fact-finding mission, Carrie was getting a picture of the man who had written this amazing book. After a third read she almost felt as if she knew him. He hadn&#x2019;t always been a recluse. He&#x2019;d been raised in Alaska and had learned to live off the land from his father, whom he apparently idolized. One thing was certain, he seemed to have no use for women. In the entire book, not once did he mention his mother or any other female influence. It was more of what he didn&#x2019;t say that caught Carrie&#x2019;s attention.</p><h2>The Auctioneer</h2><p>The independent, traditional ways of Harlowe, New Hampshire, in general, and of individualist farmer John Moore, in particular, are suddenly undermined by the systematically corruptive and destructive demands of magnetic newcomer auctioneer Perly Dunsmore</p><p>Joan Samson, deceased.

Winner of the 2010 Regina Award, she has written and illustrated more than fifty books for Holiday House. She lives in Corinth, Vermont.Kindergarten-Grade 3-A clever format and succinctly written text distinguish this offering by a prolific author. Gibbons describes bats' general physical characteristics, special traits of some half-dozen species, flying methods, use of echolocation, diet, natural habitats, hibernation, and the birth and development of young. She also discusses the decimation of bats around the world due to loss of habitats and pollution and the efforts to protect the world's only truly flying mammals. A final page offers additional miscellaneous facts. The text is clearly written and well organized. Scientific terms such as "nocturnal," "membrane," and "roosts" are clearly defined in context. Double borders enclose vivid paintings of bats in their natural habitats. While Ann Earle's Zipping, Zapping, Zooming Bats (HarperCollins, 1995) and Betsy Maestro's Bats: Night Fliers (Scholastic, 1994) cover similar ground, Gibbons's title makes an appealing addition to natural history sections.<br><br>Taking issue with the unkind and untrue things said about bats through the years, Gibbons presents children with a more favorable introduction to the species.

Deep-toned illustrations dominate the pages, showing bats in action against midnight-blue or moonlit skies. The occasional splashes of color light up brilliantly against the dark backgrounds.

Their argument is that the technological geniuses among us, "axemakers," improved our lives but also "redefined the way we thought, the values by which we lived, and the truths for which we died." We were given the world "in exchange for our minds." How? By valuing over all other human capacities the precise, sequential thought processes required to "cut-and-control" nature, each axemaker gift--from prehistoric times to the postmodern global economy--has, at least on some levels, reinforced caste distinctions between people permitted by nature and/or nurture to be "axemakers" and all other human beings. After sketching generation upon generation of the axemakers' short-term technological solutions and their unintended consequences, the authors paradoxically see hope in a new axemaker gift: information available in a "webbed" (rather than sequential) format on decentralized computer networks could empower non-axemakers to find more holistic, long-term approaches to our species'--and the planet's--problems. An eclectic, demanding analysis that will appeal to thoughtful readers. <i>Mary Carroll</i>Prolific psychologist Ornstein and historian Burke, best known for his PBS-TV series Connections, have written an ambitious, entertaining, not always convincing survey of the interaction of technology, culture, history and the human mind. Early hominids' use of tools, they maintain, altered the brain's structure over millennia, favoring reason over emotion and fostering sequential thinking, which generated language, logic and rules. With the advent of agriculture and writing in Mesopotamia came social hierarchy. The authors strain mightily to prove that successive advances in technic?the Greek alphabet, the weight-driven clock, Gutenberg's printing press, scientific method, London's stock exchange, modern clinical medicine, computers, etc.?radically altered the structure of society, increasingly concentrating power and knowledge in the hands of a specialized ruling elite that imposed ever greater degrees of conformity on the masses. A "cut-and-control" outlook that divides the world into manipulable units is held responsible for our present ecological crisis. The authors' proposed solution is a world of small communities with participatory democracy and "webbed education" whereby information-technology users can access all knowledge as a dynamic whole. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Busy Helicopter Book (Pull-back)</h2><p>Follows the path of a helicopter over cliffs, across the sea, and past rock climbers, as it performs emergency rescues, saving stranded boys and a fallen skier.

Dr. Greg L. Bahnsen, the definitive champion of Cornelius Van Til&#39;s revolutionary Reformed apologetical method, wrote this systematic treatise and defense of Biblical apologetics many years before his untimely death. Dr. Bahnsen received the typeset proofs for editing, but due to the unfortunate accidents of history, the only copy was lost. The work, consequently, was never published. In our Lord&#39;s Providence, after some twenty years, our friends at Covenant Media Foundation discovered the lost proofs. They recently sent them to us at American Vision where our enthusiastic editors busily began preparing the work for publication. Finally, our work has paid off! This magnum opus of apologetics lays out the Biblical presuppositional method, provides rigorous Biblical proof, and defends the uniqueness of the method. This is the work we all longed for Bahnsen to write, yet never knew that he already had written! Now rescued from the dustbin of history, this monument of apologetics will provide must-reading for Christian defenders of the faith for generations to come.</p><p>Dr. Greg L. Bahnsen (1948-1995) was once described as the man atheists fear most. He was a distinguished scholar, author, and Christian apologist.

Yet more and more people, caught in the terrible time-squeeze of the modern home, think of it only with abhorrence. I suspect they have not thought through the drop in their standard of living that would follow if all the fabrics in their home had to be sent out for laundering. In any event, like so many other kinds of modern housework, home laundering is much more a matter of knowing than of doing a lot. Once you know how, home laundering is little trouble and provides great benefits.</p><p><b>Should You Send Out the Laundry?</b></p><p>Centuries ago, well-to-do city dwellers sent their laundry to the country, where there were rivers to wash it and fields in which to spread it in the sun for drying and bleaching. Aristocratic French families at the end of the seventeenth century sent their soiled linens all the way to the sunny Caribbean for laundering. By 1900, the custom of sending the laundry out (or sometimes of having a laundress come do it) had been adopted by other classes and was widespread. This system had some inconveniences -- lost or poorly laundered clothes, damage, stains, clothes and linens that could not be used because they were away being laundered -- but these were overridden by its great benefits. One hundred years ago, laundering was highly labor-intensive and required elaborate facilities for washing and drying, including boilers, wringers, and mangles, a whole collection of irons and ironing equipment, drying contraptions of various sorts, and ample space indoors and out. Few city families could supply all this muscle power, time, equipment, and space -- or know-how -- so out went the laundry, or, in some cases, in came the poor laundry women.</p><p>Then came automatic washing machines and other improvements for home laundries, and the private home again took on sole responsibility for the job. Commercial laundries disappeared by the hundreds. That is why some feminists who wish to relieve women of the burdens of housekeeping have bitterly complained that home laundering is a case of a battle once won and then lost again. The calls for once more giving up home laundering, now that women have gone out to work in such numbers, have become louder and louder. In my view, home laundering is so easy, convenient, inexpensive, and successful that it is here to stay for most of us. For some, however, sending it out would be the best thing to do.</p><p>If you are single and working long hours or are part of a two-career family with children, you may sometimes find that this is a good choice for you. I know from experience that when you are tired and stressed from work, nothing cheers you up like someone delivering bundles of crisp, clean laundry. I also know from experience, however, that commercial laundries do not do nearly as good a job as you can at home, cause much faster wearing and fading of clothes and linens, and will rarely give the individual attention to cherished garments or expensive linens that you will. Commercial laundering means that you have to give up either having especially nice things or trying to keep them looking good, and you suffer the same inconveniences it caused a century ago. The garment you desperately need for a trip cannot be retrieved from the bowels of the laundry establishment until the appointed day, and even then maybe not. Special sheets or extra towels unexpectedly needed for company may be gone. Cracked buttons, discoloration, fading, and loss are still common.</p><p>The greatest problem for most people, however, is the large expense of sending the laundry out. It costs much, much more than doing the wash at home, even when the laundering services are mediocre. To have it done with anything approaching the delicate attention to individual garments and laundry problems that can be offered at home costs more than most people, even some who are relatively well off, can afford. (Because dry cleaning costs even more than commercial laundering, most of us choose some kind of laundering over dry cleaning whenever possible.)</p><p>Many people can afford the occasional use of good commercial laundries, however, and taking advantage of this possibility when you must work extralong hours or when you or your children are sick or when there is a series of meetings you must attend at the time when you would ordinarily be laundering, can be such a boon that it is worth dipping into your emergency nest egg for this service now and then. Using commercial laundries only occasionally rather than regularly has the additional advantage that it causes less overall wear and tear on your clothes than habitual commercial laundering. Another option is to use commercial laundering services for some portion of your laundry; dress shirts are the classic choice here because they almost always require heavy ironing. Just sending out the shirts saves a significant amount of time and causes a minimum of inconvenience. (But be sure to stock more shirts in the wardrobe than you would find necessary if you were doing them at home.)</p><p>You can also have someone come to your home to do your laundry, but you must take care to pick a conscientious person who knows how to do it, for the damage caused by sloppy or ignorant laundering can be immense. You might try asking the prospective employee to describe his or her laundering procedures. Questions about care labels, bleaches, permanent-press cycles, and drying temperatures tend to smoke out areas of ignorance. Even when you hire someone who understands laundry basics, however, you cannot expect the same kind of knowledge and attention you would give the task yourself; nor can you expect to pass along everything you know -- about your clothes, linens, and fabrics as well as about laundering -- especially if you have limited time to devote to training someone. And if you are going to sort, pretreat, and do a few hand-washables yourself, you are not going to save much time by having someone else do the rest, which, after all, does not take much time. What it takes is your being at home for a few hours at a stretch so that you can change loads and remove loads from the dryer. You can be doing many other things while the laundry proceeds.</p><p><b></b></p><blockquote><b>Reducing Laundry</b></blockquote><p>You can reduce the amount of laundry you have to do each week by taking any or all of the following steps:</p><p>Hang towels to dry carefully after each use.</p><p>Instead of putting lightly worn outer garments in the clothes hamper, spot-clean them (if necessary), let them air, and hang or fold them neatly.</p><p>Wear T-shirts, dress shields, camisoles, or slips under shirts, blouses, and dresses.</p><p>When you clean, cook, or do other messy jobs, protect clothing with smocks or aprons.</p><p>Use good bed manners to save laundering of bed linens and blankets: Avoid lying or sitting on the bed wearing street clothes; and always wash at least your face and hands before getting into bed. Make up your bed in the traditional way described in chapter 15, "Beds and Bedding," pages 213-20.</p><p>There are many people who truly cannot manage to be at home for a few hours. More often, however, the hours are available, but doing the laundry is felt to be a strain and a bother in a busy life. When this is the case, the cause is often a lack of experience and know-how combined with the absence of a routine that includes laundering. Habitual conduct takes the least effort, and doing what is habitual soothes rather than stresses. Know-how reduces the amount of attention a task takes and the amount of annoyance you experience in carrying it out, which enables you to focus on other things. Know-how in laundering also enables you to make the things you care about look good and last long.</p><p><b>Scheduling</b></p><p></p><blockquote>"Ain't no use havin' soap an' water if you ain't got my ingredient....I'll whisper it....It's...dirt....Get it?...D-I-R-T. Dirt."<p>-- Uncle Baldwin in Walt Kelly's Pogo</p></blockquote><p><b>Laundry Day: How Often Should You Launder?</b> In most households, doing laundry only once or twice a week is more effective and efficient than doing a load or two every day, and that is because the first step in preparing to do laundry is to accumulate an adequate stock of dirty clothes and linens to wash. It is inefficient and ineffective to run washers and dryers with very small loads; clothes come cleaner if washed in medium or larger loads and if articles of different sizes, large and small, are mixed loosely together in a load. (See chapter 4, "Laundering," page 56.) This sort of mix will also help prevent the load from becoming unbalanced. (When the load becomes unbalanced, the washing machine may automatically shut down or dance wildly across the floor.) Clothes dry faster, too, if the dryer has at least a medium fill. Moreover, if you wait until a good stock is accumulated, you will have fewer temptations to give some items improper treatment by washing them with a load of dissimilar items.</p><p>On the other hand, the accumulation of laundry should be small enough to be completed in a reasonable amount of time, and each laundry day should be fairly close in time to the last one -- a week or less. The longer the dirt stays on fabrics, the harder it is to remove. In many instances, articles should receive interim treatment to prevent permanent staining or discoloration. Dirt, particularly perspiration and many food stains, also weakens fabrics, causing them to deteriorate, fade, or turn yellow. Mildew and odor are more likely to develop if laundr...</p></p><h2>The Camping Trip That Changed America</h2><p>Caldecott medalist Mordicai Gerstein captures the majestic redwoods of Yosemite in this little-known but important story from our nation&#39;s history.

In <i>Unleashing the Ideavirus</i>, Godin describes ways to set any viable commercial concept loose among those who are most likely to catch it--and then stand aside as these recipients become infected and pass it on to others who might do the same. "The future belongs to marketers who establish a foundation and process where interested people can market to each other," he writes. "Ignite consumer networks and then get out of the way and let them talk." <p> Godin believes that a solid idea is the best route to success in the new century, but one "that just sits there is worthless." Through the magic of "word of mouse," however, the Internet offers a unique opportunity for interested individuals to transmit ideas quickly and easily to others of like mind. Taking up where his previous book <i>Permission Marketing</i> left off, Godin explains in great detail how ideaviruses have been launched by companies such as Napster, Blue Mountain Arts, GeoCities, and Hotmail. He also describes "sneezers" (influential people who spread them), "hives" (populations most willing to receive them), and "smoothness" (the ease with which sneezers can transmit them throughout a hive). In all, an infectious and highly recommended read. --<i>Howard Rothman</i></p>WHAT THE SNEEZERS ARE SAYING ABOUT SETH GODIN AND UNLEASHING THE IDEAVIRUS <p>&#x201c;When Seth Godin sneezes, watch out!

Men believe they understand women and vice versa, but really men know as much about women as a cocker spaniel knows about assembling a Weber grill.</p><p>Welcome to <em>The Mr. &amp; Mrs. Happy Handbook</em>, Steve Doocy's laugh-out-loud perspective on love, marriage, and family. The book can be used for its hilarious husband and wife wisdom or, if things aren't going well, as a projectile to get somebody's attention. This is not an advice book. It is a don't even think of trying this book. The author, his family, and his collection of friends (some very famous in the worlds of entertainment, business, and politics) have already discreetly made almost every conceivable marriage mistake, and it is their hope that this irrev- erent manual can save you the trouble of being an idiot on your own.</p><p>Doocy, co-host of <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em>, who has been married for twenty consecutive years, provides real slice-of-life stories on everything from early marriage ("I love you, you're perfect, now wear this thong") and pregnancy ("You're eating for two? Who&#x2014; you and Shaquille O'Neal?") to sending your child to college ("Is that a funnel?") and retirement (high-fiber appetizers on Viagra dates). Most of the stories conclude with "corrections" and additional wise words from Doocy's real-life wife, Kathy, who, after two decades of picking up Steve's socks in the garage, has developed a zany sense of humor herself. </p><p>There is also a handy troubleshooting section for when things go haywire, like during the eye- opening experiment undertaken especially for this book, wherein the author wanted to prove to his wife that they were perfect for each other, so he had them join an on-line dating service. Out of a database of several hundred thousand guys, he was not in her top 532 <em>local</em> men. Despite the fact that their one- month experiment ended a year ago, she's still getting photographs of single men whose head shots appear to have been taken at a recent skinhead convention. Luckily for him, she still prefers "bonehead to skinhead." </p><p>This book is a celebration of the pageantry that is wedlock, which starts with an "I do" and sometimes ends with a boiled rabbit. Let's face it, marriage isn't always as smooth as a forty-year-old's forehead after six months of Botox. In fact, marriage is ridiculously hard, but laughing about it is now incredibly easy with <em>The Mr. &amp; Mrs. Happy Handbook</em>.</p></p><p><p>Steve Doocy is an Emmy Award-winning television personality and journalist.

The Fox News Channel broadcaster shares hilarious anecdotes from his twenty-year marriage, as well as tongue-in-cheek advice for men on staying out of trouble with their wives. Steve Doocy is a humble teacher with a big heart who speaks with zesty appreciation for his one and only; his speaking voice conveys a perspective that both men and women will enjoy.

Once the foundation is laid, Louise expands into the specifics of fashion, beauty, and lifestyle, offering helpful advice from today and yesteryear on everything from finding the right underwear and buying vintage clothing, to picking the best perfume for you, and making your home a sanctuary.<br><br>As Louise says, "With a little nudging and direction, everybody can develop their own personal style, no matter their shape, age, or wallet size.

What value should we see in or attribute to it? <br><br>The war over the meaning and utility of truth is at the center of contemporary philosophical debate, and its arguments have rocked the foundations of philosophical practice. In this book, the American pragmatist Richard Rorty and the French analytic philosopher Pascal Engel present their radically different perspectives on truth and its correspondence to reality.<br><br>Rorty doubts that the notion of truth can be of any practical use and points to the preconceptions that lie behind truth in both the intellectual and social spheres. Engel prefers a realist conception, defending the relevance and value of truth as a norm of belief and inquiry in both science and the public domain. Rorty finds more danger in using the notion of truth than in getting rid of it. Engel thinks it is important to hold on to the idea that truth is an accurate representation of reality.<br><br>In Rorty's view, epistemology is an artificial construct meant to restore a function to philosophy usurped by the success of empirical science. Epistemology and ontology are false problems, and with their demise goes the Cartesian dualism of subject and object and the ancient problematic of appearance and reality. Conventional "philosophical problems," Rorty asserts, are just symptoms of the professionalism that has disfigured the discipline since the time of Kant. Engel, however, is by no means as complacent as Rorty in heralding the "end of truth," and he wages a fierce campaign against the "veriphobes" who deny its value.<br><br><i>What's the Use of Truth?</i> is a rare opportunity to experience each side of this impassioned debate clearly and concisely. It is a subject that has profound implications not only for philosophical inquiry but also for the future study of all aspects of our culture.</p><p>The war over the meaning and utility of truth is at the center of contemporary philosophical debate, and its arguments have rocked the foundations of philosophical practice.

In so doing, she illuminates with great sensitivity and intelligence the elusive emotional wellsprings of the creative process.</p><p>There is no ideal muse, but rather as many variations on the theme as there are individual women who have had the luck, or misfortune, to find their destiny conjoined with that of a particular artist. What are we to make of the relationship between the child Alice Liddell, who inspired Alice in Wonderland, and the Oxford don who became Lewis Carroll? Or the so-called serial muse, Lou Andreas-Salom�, who captivated Nietzsche, Rilke, and Freud&#x2014;as impressive a list as any muse can boast? Salvador Dal� was the only artist to sign his art with his muse's name, and Gala Dal� certainly knew how to market her artist and his work while simultaneously burnishing her own image and celebrity.</p><p>Lou, Gala, and Yoko Ono all defy the feminist stereotype of the muse as a passive beauty put on a pedestal and oppressed by a male artist. However, it's rare to find an artist and muse who are genuine partners, true collaborators, such as ballerina Suzanne Farrell and choreographer George Balanchine.</p><p>What do the nine muses chosen by Francine Prose have in common? They were all beautiful, or sexy, or gifted with some more unconventional appeal. All loved, and were loved by, their artists, and inspired them with an intensity of emotion akin to Eros. For these artists, the love of&#x2014;or for&#x2014;their muses provided an essential element required for the melding of talent and technique necessary to create art.</p></p><p>In <i>The Lives of the Muses</i>, Francine Prose writes a spirited and enlightening expos� of nine women who fired the imaginations of some of the most inimitable artists and thinkers of the 19th and 20th centuries. With wicked wit, she shows how these women were both exemplars of their times and iconoclasts struggling to assert their own identity within the unconventional relationships they formed with these men. In doing so, she undertakes an examination of the concept of the muse in all its permutations--from the static nine Muses of classical Greek mythology, through Dante's oft-recycled Beatrice, to its ironized figuration in contemporary popular culture.<p> In addition to Alice Liddell, Prose looks at the following women: Hester Thrale, a long-suffering brewer's wife whose romantic friendship allowed the depressive Dr. Samuel Johnson to continue writing; the tormented Elizabeth Siddal, an opium-addicted artist who became Beatrice to Pre-Raphaelite painter and poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti; Lou Andreas-Salome, who captivated and aroused a triumvirate of original thinkers: Friedrich Nietzsche, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Sigmund Freud; the "imperious" Gala Dali, who continued to sleep with her ex-husband, poet Paul Eluard, even as she transformed herself into a phenomenal marketing machine for surrealist Salvador Dali; Lee Miller, a model who mastered the techniques of Man Ray and others, and became a talented photographer; Suzanne Farrell, a ballerina who incarnated, animated, and was inspired to great heights of artistry by the compositions of choreographer George Balanchine; Charis Weston, one in a long line of the erotically restless Edward Weston's cast-off art wives and lovers; and the infamous Yoko Ono, who fought fiercely for recognition as an avant-garde artist as she sought to subserve John Lennon into the role of muse.</p><p> Prose draws on photographs, diaries, correspondence, memoirs, and original works of art that reveal the complexity of these artist-muse relationships, and that direct her readers to other books should their curiosity be piqued (as it undoubtedly will). Author Prose has a talent for writing provocative, invigorating prose that engages and excites the reader, inspiring them to undertake wider reading. <i>--Diana Kuprel, Amazon.ca</i></p><p>Francine Prose is the author of twenty-one works of fiction, including <em>Mister Monkey</em>; the <em>New York Times </em>bestseller <em>Lovers at the Chameleon Club, Paris 1932</em>; <em>A Changed Man</em>, which won the Dayton Literary Peace Prize; and <em>Blue Angel</em>, a finalist for the National Book Award.

To Inspector Irene Huss&#x2019; surprise, on the basis of this vague complaint her boss drives out with her to a remote cottage in snowbound southern Sweden to investigate. There they find a body, its head blasted by a rifle. Teacher Jacob Schyttelius has been murdered. When they go to break the news to his elderly parents, Pastor Sten Schyttelius and his wife, they find the couple dead in their beds, each shot between the eyes. Upside-down pentagrams have been drawn in blood on their computer screens. The only surviving member of the family is a daughter, now residing in London, but she is too distressed to be interviewed. Is the killer a member of a satanic cult? Is it the parish treasurer, rumored to have been embezzling church funds? Or one of the assistant pastors, tired of waiting for a promotion? Perhaps the attractive blonde who sings in church and practices witchcraft? Irene Huss has a hunch that the answer lies in England, and she travels there twice to discover the reason for this triple homicide. <br><br> <b>Helene Tursten</b> is the author of <i>Detective Inspector Huss</i> and <i>The Torso.</i> The latter is now a German film, and her series is being filmed for Swedish television. She lives with her husband in G�teborg.</p><p>Helene Tursten has been compared to P.D. James in her native Sweden. Her Irene Huss mysteries have been highly praised and they have been made into a film and a TV series. Tursten was a nurse and a dentist before she turned to writing. She was born in G�teborg where she now lives with her husband and daughter.The third Irene Huss mystery to appear in the U.S. is considerably less gritty than either detective <i>Inspector Huss</i>(2003) or <i>The Torso</i>(2006), but it continues Tursten's sensitive exploration of how a female detective manages to balance family life with police work: not only the time pressures but also the jarring psychological disconnects that occur when jumping between dramatically different worlds. This time Huss' case--the execution-style murders of a minister, his wife, and their schoolteacher son--takes the Swedish detective from the scene of the crime, a village outside Goteborg, to London, where the traumatized daughter of the minister lives. Road-trip mysteries inevitably sacrifice the signature landscape that is often key to the series' appeal, but in this case, the fact that Huss is on her own in London gives Tursten the opportunity to probe deeper into her heroine's character. The plot itself is less compelling than the previous two entries in the series--the shocking climax will be guessed early on--but Huss is quickly becoming one of the most satisfying lead characters in the thriving world of Swedish crime fiction. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

James Pyman is already famed for his eerily exacting and hallucinatory draftsmanship, as well as for his relish for the exploration of book formats such as cartoon or children's books, and is therefore ideally suited to the illustration of this volume. Herein, Pyman returns to the original text, illustrating a line or phrase from each of the novel's 27 chapters in a series of wonderfully sinister and weirdly clinical pencil drawings. The book, which Bram Stoker composed as a series of diaries, letters and newspaper cuttings, has been typeset by designer John Morgan with a different typeface allocated to each character--each font being based on those in use at the time of the book's original publication. As a final flourish, the striking bright yellow clothbound cover, with its vivid red lettering, is based on that of the first UK edition.</p><p><i>Dracula</i> is one of the few horror books to be honored by inclusion in the Norton Critical Edition series. (The others are <i>Frankenstein,</i> <i>The Turn of the Screw,</i> <i>Heart of Darkness,</i> <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray,</i> and <i>The Metamorphosis.</i>) This 100th-anniversary edition includes not only the complete authoritative text of the novel with illuminating footnotes, but also four contextual essays, five reviews from the time of publication, five articles on dramatic and film variations, and seven selections from literary and academic criticism. Nina Auerbach of the University of Pennsylvania (author of <i>Our Vampires, Ourselves</i>) and horror scholar David J. Skal (author of <i>Hollywood Gothic</i>, <i>The Monster Show</i>, and <i>Screams of Reason</i>) are the editors of the volume. Especially fascinating are excerpts from materials that Bram Stoker consulted in his research for the book, and his working papers over the several years he was composing it. The selection of criticism includes essays on how <i>Dracula</i> deals with female sexuality, gender inversion, homoerotic elements, and Victorian fears of "reverse colonization" by politically turbulent Transylvania.While serving as actor Henry Irving&#39;s business manager at the Lyceum Theatre in London, Bram Stoker (1847-1912) also pursued his literary interests. In this Gothic horror novel of 1897, which brought him international fame, he presents the chilling vampire Count Dracula, modelled in part on Irving&#39;s powerful personality.</p><h2>The Broken Covenant: American Civil Religion in Time of Trial</h2><p>This Second Edition represents Bellah's summation of his views on civil religion in America.

It's late afternoon. The sky is overcast, the temperatures doing a nosedive into the forties and fifties. I'm not ready for this, I think, wondering where in the world the time has gone. Seems like just yesterday we were welcoming spring and then, moments later, summer.<br><br>The phone startles me and I'm certain it's a telemarketer, so I don't initially bother to rise from my perch. I relish the last few hours of silence I have before James comes thundering through the front doors and intrudes upon my world, and the last thing I want to do is waste precious minutes on some telemarketer's sales pitch that I'm certain to refuse.<br><br>The irritating noise of the phone stops and then starts again. I answer it for no other reason than to make it stop.<br><br>"Hello?" I ask in a vexed tone, standing now in the center of the kitchen, one hip pressed against the island.<br><br>"Mrs. Dennett?" the woman asks. I consider for a moment telling her that she's got the wrong number, or ending her pitch right there with a simple <em>not interested.</em> "This is she."<br><br>"Mrs. Dennett, this is Ayanna Jackson." I've heard the name before. I've never met her, but she's been a constant in Mia's life for over a year now. How many times have I heard Mia say her name: <em>Ayanna and I did this...Ayanna and I did that....</em> She is explaining how she knows Mia, how the two of them teach together at the alternative high school in the city. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything," she says.<br><br>I catch my breath. "Oh, no, Ayanna, I just walked in the door," I lie.<br><br>Mia will be twenty-five in just a month: October 31st. She was born on Halloween and so I assume Ayanna has called about this. She wants to plan a party&#x2014;a surprise party?&#x2014;for my daughter.<br><br>"Mrs. Dennett, Mia didn't show up for work today," she says.<br><br>This isn't what I expect to hear. It takes a moment to regroup. "Well, she must be sick," I respond. My first thought is to cover for my daughter; she must have a viable explanation why she didn't go to work or call in her absence. My daughter is a free spirit, yes, but also reliable.<br><br>"You haven't heard from her?"<br><br>"No," I say, but this isn't unusual. We go days, sometimes weeks, without speaking. Since the invention of email, our best form of communication has become passing along trivial forwards.<br><br>"I tried calling her at home but there's no answer."<br><br>"Did you leave a message?"<br><br>"Several."<br><br>"And she hasn't called back?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>I'm listening only halfheartedly to the woman on the other end of the line. I stare out the window, watching the neighbors' children shake a flimsy tree so that the remaining leaves fall down upon them. The children are my clock; when they appear in the backyard I know that it's late afternoon, school is through. When they disappear inside again it's time to start dinner.<br><br>"Her cell phone?"<br><br>"It goes straight to voice mail."<br><br>"Did you&#x2014;"<br><br>"I left a message."<br><br>"You're certain she didn't call in today?"<br><br>"Administration never heard from her."<br><br>I'm worried that Mia will get in trouble. I'm worried that she will be fired. The fact that she might already be in trouble has yet to cross my mind.<br><br>"I hope this hasn't caused too much of a problem."<br><br>Ayanna explains that Mia's first-period students didn't inform anyone of the teacher's absence and it wasn't until second period that word finally leaked out: Ms. Dennett wasn't here today and there wasn't a sub. The principal went down to keep order until a substitute could be called in; he found gang graffiti scribbled across the walls with Mia's overpriced art supplies, the ones she bought herself when the administration said no.<br><br>"Mrs. Dennett, don't you think it's odd?" she asks. "This isn't like Mia."<br><br>"Oh, Ayanna, I'm certain she has a good excuse."<br><br>"Such as?" she asks.<br><br>"I'll call the hospitals. There's a number in her area&#x2014;"<br><br>"I've done that."<br><br>"Then her friends," I say, but I don't know any of Mia's friends. I've heard names in passing, such as Ayanna and Lauren and I know there's a Zimbabwean on a student visa who's about to be sent back and Mia thinks it's completely unfair. But I don't <em>know</em> them, and last names or contact information are hard to find.<br><br>"I've done that."<br><br>"She'll show up, Ayanna. This is all just a misunderstanding. There could be a million reasons for this."<br><br>"Mrs. Dennett," Ayanna says and it's then that it hits me: something is wrong. It hits me in the stomach and the first thought I have is myself seven or eight months pregnant with Mia and her stalwart limbs kicking and punching so hard that tiny feet and hands emerge in shapes through my skin. I pull out a barstool and sit at the kitchen island and think to myself that before I know it, Mia will be twenty-five and I haven't so much as thought of a gift. I haven't proposed a party or suggested that all of us, James and Grace and Mia and me, make reservations for an elegant dinner in the city.<br><br>"What do you suggest we do, then?" I ask.<br><br>There's a sigh on the other end of the line. "I was hoping you'd tell me Mia was with you," she says.<br><br><strong>GABE</strong><br><br><strong>BEFORE</strong><br><br>It's dark by the time I pull up to the house. Light pours from the windows of the English Tudor home and onto the tree-lined street. I can see a collection of people hovering inside, waiting for me. There's the judge, pacing, and Mrs. Dennett perched on the edge of an upholstered seat, sipping from a glass of something that appears to be alcoholic. There are uniformed officers and another woman, a brunette, who peers out the front window as I come to a sluggish halt in the street, delaying my grand entrance.<br><br>The Dennetts are like any other family along Chicago's North Shore, a string of suburbs that lines Lake Michigan to the north of the city. They're filthy rich. It's no wonder that I'm procrastinating in the front seat of my car when I should be making my way up to the massive home with the clout I've been led to believe I carry.<br><br>I think of the sergeant's words before assigning the case to me: <em>Don't fuck this one up.</em><br><br>I eye the stately home from the safety and warmth of my dilapidated car. From the outside it's not as colossal as I envision the interior to be. It has all the old-world charm an English Tudor has to offer: half-timbering and narrow windows and a steep sloping roof. It reminds me of a medieval castle.<br><br>Though I've been strictly warned to keep it under wraps, I'm supposed to feel privileged that the sergeant assigned this highprofile case to me. And yet, for some reason, I don't.<br><br>I make my way up to the front door, cutting across the lawn to the sidewalk that leads me up two steps, and knock. It's cold. I thrust my hands into my pockets to keep them warm while I wait. I feel ridiculously underdressed in my street clothes&#x2014;khaki pants and a polo shirt that I've hidden beneath a leather jacket&#x2014;when I'm greeted by one of the most influential justices of the peace in the county.<br><br>"Judge Dennett," I say, allowing myself inside. I conduct myself with more authority than I feel I have, displaying traces of self-confidence that I must keep stored somewhere safe for moments like this. Judge Dennett is a considerable man in size and power. Screw this one up and I'll be out of a job, best-case scenario. Mrs. Dennett rises from the chair. I tell her in my most refined voice, "Please, sit," and the other woman, Grace Dennett, I assume, from my preliminary research&#x2014;a younger woman, likely in her twenties or early thirties&#x2014;meets Judge Dennett and me in the place where the foyer ends and the living room begins.<br><br>"Detective Gabe Hoffman," I say, without the pleasantries an introduction might expect. I don't smile; I don't offer to shake hands. The girl says that she is in fact Grace, whom I know from my earlier legwork to be a senior associate at the law firm of Dalton &amp; Meyers. But it takes nothing more than intuition to know from the get-go that I don't like her; there's an air of superiority that surrounds her, a looking down on my blue-collar clothing and a cynicism in her voice that gives me the willies.<br><br>Mrs. Dennett speaks, her voice still carrying a strong British accent, though I know, from my previous fact-finding expedition, that she's been in the United States since she was eighteen. She seems panicked. That's my first inclination. Her voice is high-pitched, her fingers fidgeting with anything that comes within reach. "My daughter is missing, Detective," she sputters. "Her friends haven't seen her. Haven't spoken to her. I've been calling her cell phone, leaving messages." She chokes on her words, trying desperately not to cry. "I went to her apartment to see if she was there," she says, then admits, "I drove all the way there and the landlord wouldn't let me in."<br><br>Mrs. Dennett is a breathtaking woman. I can't help but stare at the way her long blond hair falls clumsily over the conspicuous hint of cleavage that pokes through her blouse, where she's left the top button undone. I've seen pictures before of Mrs. Dennett, standing beside her husband on the courthouse steps. But the photos do nothing compared to seeing Eve Dennett in the flesh.<br><br>"When is the last time you spoke to her?" I ask. "Last week," the judge says.<br><br>"Not last week, James," Eve says. She pauses, aware of the annoyed look on her husband's face because of the interruption, before continuing. "The week before. Maybe even the one before that. That's the way our relationship is with Mia&#x2014;we go for weeks sometimes without speaking."<br><br>"So this isn't unusual then?" I ask. "To not hear from her for a while?"<br><br>"No," Mrs. Dennett concedes.<br><br>"And what about you, Grace?"<br><br>"We spoke last week. Just a quick call. Wednesday, I believe. Maybe Thursday. Yes, it was Thursday because she called as I was walking into the courthouse for a hearing on a motion to suppress." She throws that in, just so I know she's an attorney, as if the pin-striped blazer and leather briefcase beside her feet didn't already give that away.<br><br>"Anything out of the ordinary?"<br><br>"Just Mia being Mia."<br><br>"And that means?"<br><br>"Gabe," the judge interrupts.<br><br>"Detective Hoffman," I assert authoritatively. If I have to call him <em>Judge</em> he can certainly call me <em>Detective.</em><br><br>"Mia is very independent. She moves to the beat of her own drum, so to speak."<br><br>"So hypothetically your daughter has been gone since Thursday?"<br><br>"A friend spoke to her yesterday, saw her at work."<br><br>"What time?"<br><br>"I don't know... 3:00 p.m."<br><br>I glance at my watch. "So, she's been missing for twenty-seven hours?"<br><br>"Is it true that she's not considered missing until she's been gone for forty-eight hours?" Mrs. Dennett asks.<br><br>"Of course not, Eve," her husband replies in a degrading tone.<br><br>"No, ma'am," I say. I try to be extracordial. I don't like the way her husband demeans her. "In fact, the first forty-eight hours are often the most critical in missing-persons cases."<br><br>The judge jumps in. "My daughter is not a missing person. She's <em>misplaced.</em> She's doing something rash and negligent, something irresponsible. But she's not <em>missing."</em><br><br>"Your Honor, who was the last one to see your daughter then, before she was&#x2014;" I'm a smart-ass and so I have to say it <em>"&#x2014;misplaced?"</em><br><br>It's Mrs. Dennett who responds. "A woman named Ayanna Jackson. She and Mia are co-workers."<br><br>"Do you have a contact number?"<br><br>"On a sheet of paper. In the kitchen." I nod toward one of the officers, who heads into the kitchen to get it. "Is this something Mia has done before?"<br><br>"No, absolutely not."<br><br>But the body language ofJudge and Grace Dennett says otherwise.<br><br>"That's not true, Mom," Grace chides. I watch her expectantly. Lawyers just love to hear themselves speak. "On five or six different occasions Mia disappeared from the house. Spent the night doing God knows what with God knows whom."<br><br>Yes, I think to myself, Grace Dennett is a bitch. Grace has dark hair like her dad's. She's got her mother's height and her father's shape. Not a good mix. Some people might call it an hourglass figure; I probably would, too, if I liked her. But instead, I call it plump.<br><br>"That's completely different. She was in high school. She was a little naive and mischievous, but."<br><br>"Eve, don't read more into this than there is," Judge Dennett says.<br><br>"Does Mia drink?" I ask.<br><br>"Not much," Mrs. Dennett says.<br><br>"How do you know what Mia does, Eve? You two rarely speak."<br><br>She puts her hand to her face to blot a runny nose and for a moment I am so taken aback by the size of the rock on her finger that I don't hear James Dennett rambling on about how his wife had put in the call to Eddie&#x2014;mind you, I'm struck here by the fact that not only is the judge on a first-name basis with my boss, but he's also on a <em>nickname</em> basis&#x2014;before he got home. Judge Dennett seems convinced that his daughter is out for a good time, and that there's no need for any official involvement.<br><br>"You don't think this is a case for the police?" I ask.<br><br>"Absolutely not. This is an issue for the family to handle."<br><br>"How is Mia's work ethic?"<br><br>"Excuse me?" the judge retorts as wrinkles form across his forehead and he rubs them away with an aggravated hand.<br><br>"Her work ethic. Does she have a good employment history? Has she ever skipped work before? Does she call in often, claim she's sick when she's not?"<br><br>"I don't know. She has a job. She gets paid. She supports herself. I don't ask questions."<br><br>"Mrs. Dennett?"<br><br>"She loves her job. She just loves it. Teaching is what she always wanted to do."<br><br>Mia is an art teacher. High school. I jot this down in my notes as a reminder.<br><br>The judge wants to know if I think that's important. "Might be," I respond.<br><br>"And why's that?"<br><br>"Your Honor, I'm just trying to understand your daughter. Understand who she is. That's all."<br><br>Mrs. Dennett is now on the verge of tears. Her blue eyes begin to swell and redden as she pathetically attempts to suppress the tiny drips. "You think something has happened to Mia?"<br><br>I'm thinking to myself: isn't that why you called me here? <em>You</em> think something has happened to Mia, but instead I say, "I think we act now and thank God later when this all turns out to be a big misunderstanding. I'm certain she's fine, I am, but I'd hate to overlook this whole thing without at least looking into it." I'd kick myself if&#x2014;<em>if-</em>&#x2014;it turned out everything wasn't fine.<br><br>"How long has Mia been living on her own?" I ask.<br><br>"It'll be seven years in thirty days," Mrs. Dennett states pointblank.<br><br>I'm taken aback. "You keep count? Down to the day?"<br><br>"It was her eighteenth birthday. She couldn't...</p><h2>True Courage (Uncommon Heroes, Book 4)</h2><p>Dee Henderson wraps up her Christy Award-winning Uncommon Heroes series with a riveting story from the home front.

This awesome record was the product of a genius and masterful coach named Bud Wilkinson and the spirited young men he led. <i>The Undefeated</i> will detail all the thrilling action on the field during this record winning streak, but it will also reveal all the behind-the-scenes tumult and pressure swirling around it. Dent presents an absorbing character study of the brilliant, complex coach who engineered it all - Bud Wilkinson, the on-field genius whoses starched-shirt public persona hid a man of many secrets and an in-depth look at a state and its people still suffering from a Depression hangover and an identity crisis, who took up the Sooners football banner almost as a religious cause. Through it all, the young men who accomplished this amazing feat shine in vivid life.<br></p><p>In <i>The Undefeated: The Oklahoma Sooners and the Greatest Winning Streak in College Football</i>, <i>The Junction Boys</i> author Jim Dent chronicles how Charles "Bud" Wilkinson helped the dust-bowl-depressed state of Oklahoma regain self-respect by building a program that became one of the most dominant in college sports history. From 1948 to 1957, an era when players played both sides of the ball--170-pounders played tackle, and some players smoked three packs a day--the Oklahoma Sooners dominated college football in incredible fashion: they tied twice and lost four times, and amid their 94 wins they compiled winning streaks of 31 <i>and</i> 47 games. <p> Dent has an eye for detail, and the book is equally the story of coach Wilkinson and his eccentricities, with halftime speeches and an innovative coaching style that implemented schemes not found in the NFL for decades. Also of interest are the plight of Prentice Gautt, the first black OU player during a time of racial intolerance; the hardscrabble backgrounds of the tough-as-nails players; and how preparation for big games included espionage and decoy playbooks. Most of all, Dent retells game highlights in dramatic fashion, including how an opposing receiver, after potentially ending one of OU's streaks by scoring in the final seconds, confessed he had trapped, not caught, the ball. The refs discussed the matter, and "[w]hile the man in the gray flannel suit waited, watched and paced, a crowd of 50,878 held its collective breath, and prayed."</p><p> As the wins accumulated, it became increasingly difficult for Wilkinson to motivate players and fend off all comers. In like fashion, Dent loses steam, but not before making the heartfelt case that Wilkinson's Sooners fielded some of the greatest teams in history. <i>--Michael Ferch</i></p>Jim Dent is the author of the bestselling <i>The Junction Boys</i>. He has won several national and state awards for his reporting and writing. He lives in Oklahoma.<br></p><h2>By Fire, by Moonlight (Unicorns of Balinor #4)</h2><p>With the companionship of her treasured unicorn, Sunchaser, Ari must journey to the Sixth Sea in order to escape the Glacier River Farm and return to her homeland of Balinor. Original.</p><p></p><h2>Journey to Cahokia: A Boy&#39;s Visit to the Great Mound City</h2><p>Based on new research and archival images, a coming-of-age tale of a young Native American named Little Hawk shows how his family and other members of their tribe made a trading journey from his small village to the great mound city of Cahokia in the midwestern United States, long before the appearance of the Europeans.</p><p>Albert Lorenz has written and illustrated four other children's books for Abrams. He has been praised for creating "visual excitement" by <i>The New Yorker</i>, "winning visual detail to enjoy" by <i>Booklist</i> and "utterly transporting artwork" by <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>. His illustrations appear in numerous magazines, including <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, and <i>Architectural Record</i>. Lorenz is a professor at Pratt Institute in New York.Grade 2-6&#x2013;The mound builders are among the most mysterious of Native American groups. Flourishing between 800 and 1400 C.E., their center was the great city of Cahokia, located at the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Based on recent research and illustrated with both archival photos and historically accurate drawings, this oversized volume brings their civilization to life via a fictional trip to Cahokia. Little Hawk lives in a stockaded village of wigwams near the shores of Lake Erie. An especially good harvest of furs means a trading journey, and the men decide to take their families with them. Thus, the boy takes a canoe trip down the Sciolo River to the great Ohio to the Mississippi and then north. The engaging pen-and-ink and watercolor illustrations are detailed in composition, giving readers much to look at and to absorb. The four pages of photos of artifacts pale in comparison, though they certainly add interest. The story is compelling and instructs simultaneously. An author's note gives factual information on the Cahokia site. Reminiscent of Holling C. Holling's classic<i>Paddle-to-the-Sea</i> (Houghton, 1941) in story line, size, and pictorial style, this book is sure to be popular with students interested in Native American life or archaeology, and it will also draw those who just like a good story. Excellent historical information, perfectly packaged to move.<i>&#x2013;Ann Welton, Grant Elementary School, Tacoma, WA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Its disastrous dive from the piano as a result of the shock had had in it something of the mad deliberation of a suicide's plunge. Its hideous days were over now, and Mrs. Lambert was dimly aware of another little familiar something having been withdrawn from her life.<br><br>"I hope to high heaven this last one satisfies him for this spring at least," was the petulant comment of Alfred, the male annex of Alice.<br><br>"I've been waiting and waiting and waiting," came a thin disembodied voice from a dark corner. "Night and day I've been waiting and expecting----"<br>"And hoping and praying, no doubt, Grandpa," interrupted Daphne, idly considering a run in her stocking and wondering what she was going to do about it if anything, and when would be the least boring time to do it if she did, which she doubted.<br>"Alice," complained Grandpa Lambert from the security of his shadows, "that baggage has no respect for her elders."<br><br>Stella, femininely desirable but domestically a washout, made one of her typical off-balance entrances. It started with a sort of scrambled hovering at the door, developed this into a mad dash into the room, and terminated in a tragic example of suspended animation somewhere in the immaculate neighborhood of Mrs. Alice Pollard Lambert.<br>"Been an explosion, ma'am," announced Stella in a deflated voice. "Mr. Betts says so."<br><br>"Now all you need to do is to fall dead at our feet to make the picture complete," remarked Daphne.<br>"Yes, Miss Daffy," said Stella brightly.<br>"And if Mr. Betts says there's been an explosion," Daffy continued, "then there must have been an explosion. Betts is never wrong. You go back, Stella dear, and thank him for letting us know so promptly."<br>"But, Miss Daffy, what shall we do about it?" asked Stella, vainly looking for some light to guide amid the encircling gloom.<br>"About what, Stella?" asked Daffy.<br>"This explosion, miss," and Stella extended her hands as if she were offering a young explosion for the inspection of Daphne.<br><br>"Stella," that young lady explained with sweet but jaded patience, "one doesn't do things about explosions. Explosions are quite competent to do things for themselves. All sorts of things. The most one can do for an explosion is to leave it entirely alone until it has decided to become a ruin. Also, you can blink at an explosion respectfully in the news reels and feel good about its ghastly results. You'll probably gasp at this one on your night off next Thursday." She paused, then added, "With that stout fellow Tim breathing heavily in your left ear."<br><br>This last realistic observation was enough to effect the untidy departure of Stella.<br>"Oh, Miss Daffy," was all that maiden said.<br>"I do wish she would refrain from calling you by that vulgar sobriquet," said Mrs. Lambert.<br>"Why, Mother?" the daughter asked. "I am. Very. That's why I like myself, and that's why I like him. He's daffy, too."<br>She pointed in the general direction of the explosion.<br>"In that you're right, for a change," agreed her father. "He belongs in some institution. What does he mean by getting us here in this house and then having explosions all over the place? I call it downright inconsiderate."<br><br>If Mr. Alfred Pollard Lambert had forgotten the small detail that after having lost his wife's fortune in various business misadventures he had sought sanctuary for himself and dependents in his brother-in-law's previously tranquil home, Daffy had not been so remiss. However, out of an innate sense of sportsmanship she rejected the opening her bumptious parent had offered her, merely contenting herself by observing:<br><br>"Well, if I had a home of my own I'd explode all over it as much as I jolly well liked. I'd explode from attic to cellar just as long as I felt the least bit explosive."<br>"I know, my dear," said her mother. "No one is saying your uncle hasn't a perfect right to explode whenever and wherever he pleases, but you must admit there's a certain limitation, certain restrictions of decency. One explosion, even two, we could understand and condone, but a series, a constant fusillade--it isn't normal. Good taste alone would suggest a little less boisterous avocation and a little less dangerous one."<br><br>"But, Mother," protested the girl, "he has never invited any of us to participate in one of his explosions. He's been very decent about it and kept them entirely to himself."<br>"Most of these scientific johnnies are content with a couple of explosions," said Alfred, "but your uncle is never satisfied. He seems to think that life is just one long Fourth of July."<br><br>"The day will come," intoned the devitalized voice from the corner. "Mark the words of an old man. The day will come when we'll find ourselves completely blown to bits."<br>This dire prediction struck Daphne as funny. She allowed herself several contemplative giggles.<br><br>"I can see it all," she said. "A lot of bits rushing busily about in a mad scramble to find one another. Hands collecting feet, legs, livers, and such, and putting them aside in a neat pile until all the bits have been assembled. Well, I hope I don't find some of this," she continued, spanking herself resoundingly. "I'm getting altogether too self-assertive in that quarter."<br><br>"Daphne!" Mrs. Lambert exclaimed. "You're positively obscene."<br>For a moment the young lady stood in rapt contemplation of some inner glory.<br>"I have it," she said at last. "Listen:<br><br>"Said a certain king to his queen:<br>'In spots you grow far from lean.'<br>'I don't give a damn,<br>You've always loved ham,'<br>She replied, and he said, 'How obscene!' "<br>From the dark corner inhabited by Grandpa Lambert issued a strange and unexpected sound, a sound which partook of the nature of both a cough and a cackle, such a sound as might clatter from the lipless mouth of a skull well pleased by some macabre memory.<br><br>"Why, Father!" exclaimed Alfred Lambert. "You're laughing, actually laughing."<br>"And at such a thing," added Mrs. Lambert with deep disapproval.<br>"Can't help it," wheezed the old gentleman. "Always had a weakness for limericks. Got a few of my own if I could only remember them."<br>He promptly fell to brooding not uncheerfully over those lost limericks of other years.<br>"You old darling," said Daffy, going over to the thin, crouched figure. "You've been holding out on me."<br>"Disgraceful," sniffed Alice Pollard Lambert. "Demoralizing."<br><br>Alfred made no further comment. He had a well defined suspicion that the old chap was holding out on him something far more desirable than limericks. If he could only lay his hands on his father's bank book. For some years now an inspection of that little book had been one of Alfred Lambert's chief aims in life. Just one little peek was all he asked. After that he could order his conduct according to the size of the figures in the book. As things stood now he was being in all likelihood dutifully and enduringly filial without any assurance of adequate compensation. Yet there was always that chance, that slim but not impossible chance. Hellishly tantalizing for an acquisitive nature. Alfred's was such a nature.<br><br>"There's one about the Persians," the old man was saying to his granddaughter. "Oh, a delightful thing, my dear child, an exquisite bit of vulgarity. Of course, I couldn't repeat it to you. Maybe after you're married. I'll tell your husband, and he'll tell you--if he's the right sort of a husband."<br><br>"I'm sure Alfred never sullies my ears with such indecencies," said Mrs. Lambert with a rising inflection in her overcultured voice.<br>"He doesn't get out enough," grated the old man. "Do you both good."<br>"Your suggestion, Grandpa, is the greatest inducement to matrimony I've ever had," said Daphne, patting the old man's shoulder. "I'll look for a victim immediately."<br><br>"A full-legged girl like yourself shouldn't have far to look," the old man said with an unedifying chuckle. "In my day young men had to depend almost entirely on the sense of touch in such matters. Nowadays the sense of sight seems to play a more important part. It simplifies things, perhaps, but robs courtship of a lot of adventure."<br>"Disgusting!" pronounced Mrs. Lambert, then added with a view to changing the subject, "Don't you think, Alfred, that Stella was right? Shouldn't we do something about this explosion?"<br><br>"Perhaps," agreed Alfred. "He usually comes out after he's had one."<br>"Rather rapidly," remarked Daffy. "The last time he came out through the side of the house with a couple of bricks in his pants."<br>"But he hates to be disturbed," went on Mrs. Lambert. "You know how he is."<br>"I know how he was," replied Daffy. "How he is now, God only knows."<br>"Perhaps it got him this time," suggested Grandpa Lambert, not without a touch of complacency.<br><br>"Think we should go, Alfred?" asked his wife.<br>"Well, if that explosion failed to disturb him," Mr. Lambert observed, "I don't see how the intervention of mere mortals cou...</p><h2>Red and Rover: A Boy, A Dog, A Time, A Feeling</h2><p>First there was Bogey and Bacall, then Butch and Sundance.

His contentment is disturbed one day when the wizard, Gandalf, and the company of dwarves arrive to take him away on an adventure.</p><p><i>"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."</i> <p> The hobbit-hole in question belongs to one Bilbo Baggins, an upstanding member of a "little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves." He is, like most of his kind, well off, well fed, and best pleased when sitting by his own fire with a pipe, a glass of good beer, and a meal to look forward to. Certainly this particular hobbit is the last person one would expect to see set off on a hazardous journey; indeed, when Gandalf the Grey stops by one morning, "looking for someone to share in an adventure," Baggins fervently wishes the wizard elsewhere. No such luck, however; soon 13 fortune-seeking dwarves have arrived on the hobbit's doorstep in search of a burglar, and before he can even grab his hat or an umbrella, Bilbo Baggins is swept out his door and into a dangerous adventure.</p><p> The dwarves' goal is to return to their ancestral home in the Lonely Mountains and reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, they and their reluctant companion meet giant spiders, hostile elves, ravening wolves--and, most perilous of all, a subterranean creature named Gollum from whom Bilbo wins a magical ring in a riddling contest. It is from this life-or-death game in the dark that J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, would eventually spring. Though <i>The Hobbit</i> is lighter in tone than the trilogy that follows, it has, like Bilbo Baggins himself, unexpected iron at its core. Don't be fooled by its fairy-tale demeanor; this is very much a story for adults, though older children will enjoy it, too. By the time Bilbo returns to his comfortable hobbit-hole, he is a different person altogether, well primed for the bigger adventures to come--and so is the reader. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><p><b>Scenes from <em>The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies</em></b></p> <em> </em> Luke Evans as Bard and Orlando Bloom as Legolas in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, in theatres December 17, 2014.

Led by <em>The Entertainer</em>, one of the most popular pieces of the mid-1970s, a revival of his music resulted in events unprecedented in American musical history. Never before had any composer's music been so acclaimed by both the popular and classical music worlds. While reaching a "Top Ten" position in the pop charts, Joplin's music was also being performed in classical recitals and setting new heights for sales of classical records. His opera <em>Treemonisha</em> was performed both in opera houses and on Broadway.<br> Destined to be the definitive work on the man and his music, <em>King of Ragtime</em> is written by Edward A. Berlin. A renowned authority on Joplin and the author of the acclaimed and widely cited <em>Ragtime: A Musical and Cultural History</em>, Berlin redefines the Scott Joplin biography. Using the tools of a trained musicologist, he has uncovered a vast amount of new information about Joplin. His biography truly documents the story of the composer, replacing the myths and unsupported anecdotes of previous histories. He shows how Joplin's opera <em>Treemonisha</em> was a tribute to the woman he loved, a woman other biographers never even mentioned. Berlin also reveals that Joplin was an associate of Irving Berlin, and that he accused Berlin of stealing his music to compose <em>Alexander's Ragtime Band</em> in 1911.<br> Berlin paints a vivid picture of the ragtime years, placing Scott Joplin's story in its historical context. The composer emerges as a representative of the first post-Civil War generation of African Americans, of the men and women who found in the world of entertainment a way out of poverty and lowly social status. <em>King of Ragtime</em> recreates the excitement of these pioneers, who dreamed of greatness as they sought to expand the limits society placed upon their race.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Edward A. Berlin</strong>, who has a Ph.D. in musicology, is a major speaker and writer in today's ragtime world. His book <em>Ragtime: A Musical and Cultural History</em> is the most widely cited study of the subject, and his monograph <em>Reflections and Research on Ragtime</em> (1987) is winner of an ASCAP-Deems Taylor Award.<br>The second biography of legendary ragtime composer Joplin to appear this year (the first was Susan Curtis's Dancing to a Black Man's Tune: A Life of Scott Joplin, p. 450), written from the perspective of a musicologist. Like Curtis, Berlin (Ragtime: A Musical and Cultural History, 1980) is frustrated by the scarcity of evidence--either oral or documentary--that remains about Joplin's life. His whereabouts for entire years are missing, and the reasons for several key decisions that he made regarding the publication and performance of his music are shrouded in mystery. Thus, while Berlin gives a more-or-less straightforward chronological account, he is often reduced to making educated guesses. Given these drawbacks, Berlin has done a dogged job of digging up what little documentary evidence exists; he even proves that Joplin had a second wife, who died shortly after their marriage. He analyzes Joplin's musical compositions at length, in language that graduate students of musicology will enjoy (``[Joplin] had discovered the propulsive power of...goal directed voice-leading''), if not the general reader. Berlin's insights into Joplin's compositional process are enlightening; he reveals that the composer worked on paper, enabling him to create unusually complex harmonic structures. Joplin was only a mediocre pianist himself, and so rarely performed; he even had to learn to play some of his harder pieces. Berlin also goes beyond analyzing the ragtime compositions (``Maple Leaf Rag,'' ``The Entertainer'') that are most closely associated with the composer, giving balanced and generally fair accounts of Joplin's popular songs, parlor piano pieces, and his ill-fated opera, Treemonisha. The book concludes with a brief history of the ragtime revival and a complete list of Joplin's works. Together, Curtis and Berlin give about as much information as we can hope for on this important American composer. For one-stop shoppers, Berlin edges out the competition, thanks to his more thorough knowledge of music. (Illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

From king-sized quilts to wall hangings, and more, this beautifully illustrated book has something for sewers of every skill level. To top it all off, author Kathreen Ricketson founder of the hugely popular craft site WhipUp.net offers expert shortcuts and step-by-step instructions.</p><p>When I first began designing the quilts for the book, I drew upon my art and photography background to research ideas, mixing tradition and contemporary together - taking in colour, contrasts, shapes and patterns from different cultures and handmade traditions such as Japanese Shibori, Latvian embroidery, Indian architecture and Mid-century fabric design. I knew I wanted my personal style (vintage/modern and cosy) to shine through strongly - while at the same time creating young, vibrant and graphic designs - I hope I succeeded and I hope you enjoy the book!Making 20 quilts in a short space of time is quite physically demanding - so I devised a method of sewing standing up which really saved my back. Mentally it was a challenge too - all that math! And yes I quilted all the quilts (with the exception of one) myself at home on a mid arm quilting machine.Big lovely thank you to my husband Rob Shugg who is the genius behind the hand drawn illustrations, my two cheeky children who appear angelic in the book.
